Oh God! What happened now?

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:49.877
What.. where?

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:52.391
This.. everything is fine.

00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:55.891
That.. dream. Dream.
- Dream? - Yes.

00:03:56.024 --> 00:03:57.024
Imagination?
- Yes.

00:03:57.523 --> 00:03:59.777
I'm sure there is
something fishy.

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:01.177
What.. what's fishy!

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:02.424
You've lost your mind.

00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.811
Me.. great! You're accusing me?

00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.257
Accusing!
- Hey..

00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.711
You act funny! You never
let me sleep at peace!

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:11.891
Such a pain!

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:14.944
Everyone dreams! It
isn't in our hand.

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:18.477
Exactly. It's not in our
hand, but in our head.

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:21.844
Go and consult a psychiatrist.
And get it treated.

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.124
Treatment?

00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:25.196
(Whispers) How can I tell about my dreams?

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:26.824
(Whispers) She's nagging early morning.

00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:30.311
You've lost your mind!
- I was thinking.

00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:33.757
What are you thinking!
It's over the limit.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:37.511
Find a permanent solution!
It's a big pain!

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:39.757
How long will you scream!

00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:41.824
Look at the time and day!

00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:43.711
Today is Rashmi's birthday.

00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:45.977
Don't start nagging first thing
in the morning.

00:04:46.057 --> 00:04:47.124
Oh, dear!

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:50.077
You remember your daughter's birthday.
- Obviously.

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.131
It's Rashmi's birthday,
then Ra..

00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:54.277
Then it will be your birthday.

00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:56.635
I think, I..
- Go and freshen up!

00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:58.257
Ok. I'll freshen up!

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.100
It's Rahul's birthday too.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.167
I should leave!

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:08.787
Father, today is my birthday,
yet you're going on a tour.

00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:09.967
I won't talk to you.

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:12.287
Child, I'm helpless! I've
no other option.

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:14.100
No option! Say, you don't care.

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:17.100
You always come and
leave in a hurry.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.900
You don't stay at home.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.600
Dear, I'm doing all this for you.
- Yes.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.300
But stay today for my birthday.
- Yes.

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:26.874
What can I do, child?

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:29.487
Today is your brother
Rahul's birthday too.

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:31.000
Both were born on the same day.

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:33.008
God's ways are strange!

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.100
God's ways or your
ways are strange?

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:40.287
Can't you stay home for a day
on your child's birthday?

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.167
It makes a big difference
to me, not to you.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.279
Do I always act so?

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.600
I love you, similarly
I love him..

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.153
What? Whom?

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:53.887
I mean my job and my duty.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:57.453
Yes! - I refer getting scolded
by my daughter than my boss.

00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:58.933
You'll like if I get insulted.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.874
She doesn't respect me!
- Child, tell me.

00:06:02.954 --> 00:06:05.493
Will you like if anyone scolds me
on your birthday?

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:06.900
Tell me, Rashmi.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.306
Father, you may go.
- Ok.

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.520
Look at the difference
between your age.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600
Learn to be wise like her.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.387
You've lost your mind.

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:16.920
Why does she always say so?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.033
Let it be.
- Ok.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.100
My gift?
- It'll be home in the afternoon.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.587
Home delivery.
- Sure?

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:23.700
Promise.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.733
By the way, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

00:06:36.367 --> 00:06:37.500
Come quickly.

00:06:38.052 --> 00:06:39.955
How much is the fare?
- 130.

00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:44.138
Brother.
- What?

00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:45.571
Dhodhapkar's friend is here.

00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:48.838
Yes, for the pay 25 years
I've been seeing this.

00:06:49.453 --> 00:06:50.705
Why does he come daily?

00:06:51.148 --> 00:06:53.371
Take, sir.
- There is some secret.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.238
They're best friends.

00:06:57.755 --> 00:06:59.405
(Door knocking)
- That's fine..

00:06:59.734 --> 00:07:01.938
..but Dhodhapkar has passed
his marriageable age..

00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:03.048
..why doesn't he marry.

00:07:03.532 --> 00:07:04.691
(Laughs)

00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:05.805
Come.

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:08.105
He should get what he desires!

00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:09.835
(Laughs)

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.371
He came early in the morning
to ruin my sleep.

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:17.671
(Door knocking) Dhodhapkar.
- Coming.

00:07:18.793 --> 00:07:21.038
Open the door.
- Coming.

00:07:31.602 --> 00:07:34.971
Hey, fool! Get up. Don't sleep.

00:07:35.338 --> 00:07:37.058
What is it early in the morning?

00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:39.705
Early morning! It's noon and
you say it's morning.

00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:41.291
You're still sleeping. Get up.

00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:44.291
I can do whatever I
want in my house.

00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:46.565
You've no discipline to wake up.

00:07:46.645 --> 00:07:47.958
That's why you don't get a girl.

00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:51.571
Don't rub salt on my wounds.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.005
Forget get. Get ready quickly.

00:07:54.305 --> 00:07:57.138
Come. - Where?
- We've to go out.

00:07:57.238 --> 00:07:59.091
Come.
- I won't come with you.

00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:01.725
Don't say that. Today is Rahul's
and Rashmi's birthday.

00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:04.558
I've to give them gifts. Come quickly.
- I'll drop you.

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:06.238
I'm not your servant.

00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:08.952
You're my good friend.
Come quickly.

00:08:09.138 --> 00:08:13.055
You married twice secretly and
I've to face the problems.

00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:16.571
Dhodhapkar, one should
have good luck for it.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.171
Marriages are made in heaven.

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.605
We're nothing!
- You're shameless.

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:24.505
Have some shame!

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:30.591
Dhodhapkar, what's there
to be ashamed about?

00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:33.571
Circumstances forced
me to remarry.

00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:36.019
I didn't get a chance
to marry once.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.202
(Laughs)

00:08:37.338 --> 00:08:40.571
How can you? Luck favours
those who work hard.

00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:43.068
You're insulting me.
- Shut up!

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.048
I'm talking about myself.

00:08:45.636 --> 00:08:49.935
Tell me, if you find a winning
lottery ticket on road..

00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:52.625
..will you cash it or tear it.

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:55.025
Don't call sister-in-law Anjali,
a lottery ticket.

00:08:55.105 --> 00:08:56.138
What happened?

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:59.705
Dhodhapkar, talk to me
with respect. Got it?

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.786
Was I responsible for sir
Jagirdar's accident?

00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:06.324
It was a terrible situation.

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:08.471
I was the one and only one.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.491
Got it?
- Is your recording over?

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.824
It's fact. And you
know everything.

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:16.650
Yet you taunt me.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.838
Be careful while talking to me.
- I accept my mistake.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.791
But don't you think that you're
betraying your two wives?

00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:25.391
Fool! Both my wives don't know..

00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.169
..so there is no question
of betrayal.

00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:28.111
(Laughs)

00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:30.438
This is called administration
skill.

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.371
And honestly, it's possible
only because of you.

00:09:34.944 --> 00:09:37.089
Only because of you.
Credit goes to you.

00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:39.024
Let's go.
- Where?

00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:41.558
Fool, we've to buy gifts
to Rashmi and Rahul.

00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:43.040
There's something wrong.

00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:45.771
What?
- I forgot to do some work.

00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:48.224
We'll do it later. I'll
drop you on the way.

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:50.638
No, how can you help me
in my personal work?

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:52.138
What work?

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:54.715
Yes, I forgot to bathe.

00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:58.758
Who will look at you? Come.
- At least let me brush.

00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:00.371
You don't need to. Come.

00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:03.604
Brother, they're going.

00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:17.291
Brother, tell me something.

00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:19.371
What?
- He comes in cab and goes in car.

00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:22.097
He comes in car and goes in cab.

00:10:22.304 --> 00:10:24.291
When he comes in the house,
they close the door.

00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:25.804
I don't know what's going on.

00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:28.471
Didn't I tell you earlier?

00:10:28.876 --> 00:10:31.349
(Laughs)

00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:33.524
Dhodhapkar.
- Yes.

00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:35.858
I've bought a laptop for Rahul
and one for Rashmi.

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:37.424
It'll be even.
- Right.

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.104
Let's buy a calculator too.

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:43.058
Why?
- I wanted to have a calculator of my own.

00:10:43.138 --> 00:10:45.681
So can I buy it? On my account.

00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.191
You don't have wife or child,
so forget the account.

00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.291
Keep it there.
- Listen, Anant..

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:51.741
I'll buy on your birthday.
- Ok.

00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:53.187
Sure. - Sure?
- Let's go.

00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:55.974
You'll really buy it.
- Yes. - Let's go.

00:10:56.054 --> 00:10:58.307
I'll gift you.
- Ok, fine.

00:10:58.387 --> 00:10:59.483
Ok.
- Yes.

00:11:02.387 --> 00:11:03.764
I'm buying these two laptops.

00:11:03.844 --> 00:11:04.807
(Phone rings)

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:05.954
Excuse me.

00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:08.366
Manish, pack this.
- (Phone rings)

00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:09.902
It's Rahul's phone.
- Listen..

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:11.569
..give Rahul and Rashmi's
address and..

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:12.982
..tell them to deliver them.
- Ok.

00:11:13.082 --> 00:11:15.069
We've to deliver them on
different addresses. - Ok.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:17.982
This is for Rahul.. write down the name.
- Ok.

00:11:18.062 --> 00:11:20.093
Rahul Kitturkar and
Rashmi Kitturkar.

00:11:20.173 --> 00:11:21.382
Yes, Rahul.

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:23.915
Happy birthday to you.
- Thanks, dad.

00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:28.715
I'm sending a surprise gift.
- What's the gift?

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:31.315
How can I tell you the surprise?

00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:33.349
By the way, where are you?

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.882
(Clears throat) I'm at.. the airport.
I've just landed.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.742
And I'm going to office.
- Oh!

00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:41.385
We'll go for dinner
in the evening.

00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:44.135
No. I'm going to pub
with my friends.

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:45.815
No, problem. Enjoy yourself.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.315
Put mother on line.
- It's dad.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.482
Hello.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.649
Where are you? No
phone, nothing.

00:11:53.729 --> 00:11:55.309
Sir, check the addresses.

00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:58.249
You've written it, it must be
correct. I don't need to check.

00:11:58.553 --> 00:12:00.950
Sonali?
- Yes. - Nice name.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.969
Have I hidden anything from you?

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:05.215
Have I done anything
to arouse doubts?

00:12:05.295 --> 00:12:08.282
I know. But I get tense
seeing you so busy.

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:10.334
Don't worry. Don't be tense.

00:12:10.414 --> 00:12:12.453
We'll take dinner tonight. Bye.

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:14.715
Is your marriage fixed?
- No.

00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:17.915
Your family are looking for a groom?
- Yes.

00:12:17.995 --> 00:12:19.202
Really? Very good.

00:12:19.282 --> 00:12:20.602
Gave the addresses?
- Yes.

00:12:20.682 --> 00:12:22.702
Please, delivery is urgent.
- I'll see to it.

00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:24.482
Manish, take this.
- Manisha.

00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:26.682
He's Manish. Take it.

00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:29.615
Take it quickly.

00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:31.869
Where do you stay?
- Kandivali.

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:33.661
Ok. East or West.
- On the station.

00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:35.782
Come.

00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:38.769
She's married.
- She said no.

00:12:38.849 --> 00:12:41.569
It's obvious from her face.
- I asked her.

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:43.000
Come with me.
- Listen..

00:12:49.797 --> 00:12:51.382
Why are you quiet?

00:12:51.656 --> 00:12:53.882
I'm thinking?
- About what?

00:12:53.962 --> 00:12:55.282
I can't remember that.

00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:56.568
(Laughs)

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:59.682
Yes, calculator.
- I don't remember.

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:03.902
I just remembered.
I've a question.

00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:06.882
How can you lie so casually?

00:13:07.768 --> 00:13:09.102
It's no big deal.

00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:11.902
When we lie, we've to
remember everything.

00:13:11.982 --> 00:13:14.102
I don't remember what happened
a moment ago.

00:13:14.182 --> 00:13:16.569
And you've been lying for
the past 25 years.

00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:19.749
If a man wants to be happy,
he has to lie a little.

00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:22.196
No. It's against my principle.

00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:25.135
Those don't get chance,
talk of principles.

00:13:25.215 --> 00:13:26.249
You're right.

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:29.502
I show bow to you. How
do you manage it?

00:13:29.582 --> 00:13:32.169
I use some brains and some lies.

00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:33.649
One shouldn't confuse oneself.

00:13:33.907 --> 00:13:36.582
Two houses in two directions.
No connection. Simple.

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:39.749
We're old friends but you
didn't take me home.

00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:42.782
Friendship is for outside,
not in the house.

00:13:43.315 --> 00:13:45.182
But you come to my
house anytime.

00:13:45.374 --> 00:13:47.102
You ruin my privacy.
What about that?

00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:49.982
You've no wife so why privacy?

00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:55.135
Some day I'll tell your two
wives everything. - Ok.

00:13:55.215 --> 00:13:57.800
I'll be get rid of
all my problems.

00:13:58.207 --> 00:13:59.949
You've been threatening
me for 25 years.

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:01.382
It's not possible for you.

00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:03.502
Ok.
- Where should I drop you?

00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:05.702
Drop me here. Pull over right now.

00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:07.735
Ok.
- Stop. - Don't shout.

00:14:07.815 --> 00:14:09.049
Wait a minute.

00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:10.949
This isn't my father's road.

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:13.482
Pull over.
- Ok, dear.

00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:16.382
I'll go to Ghatkopar and tell
sister-in-law Anjali everything.

00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:18.915
Anjali lives in Malabar Hill,
not Ghatkopar.

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:22.812
And Rahul?
- Of course with Anjali in Malabar Hill.

00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:27.302
What happened?

00:14:27.382 --> 00:14:30.282
I've been thinking
what I did wrong.

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.149
Meaning? What did you do?

00:14:33.883 --> 00:14:35.669
Did you interchange
the addresses?

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:39.649
You say that Rashmi and not
Rahul stays in Ghatkopar..

00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:42.644
Dhodhapkar, what have you done?

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.035
I'm ruined.
- I made a mistake.

00:14:45.115 --> 00:14:47.935
Is it so simple! You've
said it so easily!

00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:49.778
You're telling me now.

00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:51.911
I just remembered because
that topic came up.

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.744
Oh! I'm doomed!

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:56.178
If gifts are interchanged,
I'll be ruined.

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:58.958
And these days deliveries are really quick.
- Shut up!

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.958
Sonali!
- Yes.

00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:11.178
Excuse me.
- Yes.

00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:13.558
I told you to deliver two gifts.
- Rahul and Rashmi.

00:15:13.775 --> 00:15:16.424
Two laptops.
- Malabar Hill and Ghatkopar.

00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:18.011
Sir, we've delivered them.

00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:21.458
Sonali, there is a problem.
Addresses were wrong.

00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:25.058
I know. Rahul Kitturkar had phoned.
- What did he say?

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.877
He asked for Rashmi's number.

00:15:26.957 --> 00:15:28.278
You didn't give him.
- I gave him.

00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:29.858
You gave him!
- What have you done?

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.311
He's Anant Kitturkar. He has
two wives and two children.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.022
One is in Ghatkopar and
one in Malabar Hill. - Anant left.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.224
Tell me your Kandivali's
address correctly..

00:15:38.324 --> 00:15:39.711
..so that there is no problem.

00:15:39.791 --> 00:15:40.993
Platform number two.

00:15:42.324 --> 00:15:43.491
Is her father a porter?

00:15:48.024 --> 00:15:49.924
Where do you stay?
- (Rashmi) Ghatkopar.

00:15:50.248 --> 00:15:51.844
Oh! Ghatkopar!
- Yes.

00:15:51.924 --> 00:15:53.863
And you?
- In Malabar Hill. - Oh!

00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:56.158
And don't be so formal?

00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:59.406
(Rahul) Call me just Rahul.
- Ok.

00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:00.945
Rahul.
- I like it.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.191
What?
- Your name.

00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:07.391
Rashmi. Very nice.

00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:12.126
Anyways, many, many happy
returns of the day.

00:16:12.724 --> 00:16:14.591
Oh! Thank you. Wish
you the same.

00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:16.891
But what about my gift?
- And mine?

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:19.691
Where should we meet?

00:16:20.724 --> 00:16:21.791
Sixth Sense Mall.

00:16:22.038 --> 00:16:23.158
(Rashmi) Ok, no problem.

00:16:23.238 --> 00:16:25.124
(Phone rings)
- Just hold.

00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:27.687
Hello.

00:16:28.891 --> 00:16:30.958
Hi, sweetheart.
- Hello, can I call you later?

00:16:31.058 --> 00:16:33.958
Listen. Many, many happy
returns of the day.

00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:35.291
Thanks, darling.

00:16:35.558 --> 00:16:37.244
I'm busy right now.
Can I call you back?

00:16:37.324 --> 00:16:38.758
Listen.
- I'll phone you later.

00:16:38.858 --> 00:16:39.891
Bye.
- But..

00:16:41.558 --> 00:16:44.656
Yes, Rashmi. In the
evening. Confirmed?

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.925
Ok. - But how will we recognize
each other?

00:16:48.358 --> 00:16:50.078
We'll have gifts in our hands.

00:16:50.158 --> 00:16:51.351
Yes, correct.

00:17:00.128 --> 00:17:01.491
What are you saying?

00:17:02.524 --> 00:17:03.558
Even Anant?
- Yes.

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:05.504
And Kitturkar too?

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:09.271
Not just that. Our birthday
falls today.

00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:10.771
Oh! Really?

00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:12.704
That's why gifts were exchanged.

00:17:12.784 --> 00:17:14.785
I talked to him.

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:18.784
But where does this Rahul
Kitturkar lives?

00:17:19.117 --> 00:17:22.184
In Malabar Hill.
- Oh, dear! Malabar Hill!

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.151
We should call him home once.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:28.284
We're going to meet?
- You've fixed a meeting?

00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.105
To exchange the gifts.

00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:35.851
Meet him. We should meet
people at this age.

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:39.840
(Laughs)

00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.784
Why are you laughing?

00:17:42.987 --> 00:17:46.063
Nothing. I just thought
of something.

00:17:46.143 --> 00:17:47.717
What?
- That..

00:17:48.712 --> 00:17:50.649
..if you marry him..

00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:53.634
..you won't have to change
surname after marriage.

00:17:54.717 --> 00:17:55.984
Mother, you're too much!

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:57.551
I've not even seen him.

00:17:57.984 --> 00:17:59.462
What's the need?

00:18:00.184 --> 00:18:01.962
He lives in Malabar Hill.

00:18:02.317 --> 00:18:06.304
So were so many coincidences!
This too can work out!

00:18:06.384 --> 00:18:08.084
Right?
- Please.

00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:12.537
(Anant) You fool! Do you know how big
mistake you've made?

00:18:12.996 --> 00:18:14.562
(Anant) You've put me in a problem!
- (Dhodhapkar groans)

00:18:14.642 --> 00:18:17.355
(Dhodhapkar) But to err is human!
What's the big deal!

00:18:17.435 --> 00:18:19.724
Human! You're a donkey!

00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:21.644
(Dhodhapkar groans)

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.151
Anant, it was fun!

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:30.121
But you're not as
strong as before!

00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:34.358
Do you know what a big
mistake you did?

00:18:34.723 --> 00:18:36.757
Till today I didn't let
anybody know about it.

00:18:36.837 --> 00:18:39.011
Because of you today Rahul
and Rashmi will meet.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.023
A brother and sister
will meet. So what?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.857
It's good.

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:45.826
Are you out of your mind?

00:18:45.906 --> 00:18:47.777
They don't know they're
brother and sister.

00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:50.899
They'll be surprised when they meet?
So what?

00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:51.890
So what?
- Yes.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.643
What about my ruination?

00:18:53.723 --> 00:18:55.623
I don't like this.

00:18:55.788 --> 00:18:57.410
You always think of yourself.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.424
I'm thinking about
the entire family.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.723
Come here.

00:19:01.947 --> 00:19:05.257
From Rahul's behaviour I felt
that he was impressed by Rashmi.

00:19:05.337 --> 00:19:07.857
What if they fall in love?
- Oh, dear!

00:19:07.937 --> 00:19:09.377
What if they decide to marry?

00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:11.377
Oh God! I didn't think of that.

00:19:11.457 --> 00:19:13.490
And it'll be because of you.
Remember that!

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.890
We've to find a permanent solution.
- Yes.

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.057
(Snaps finger) Yes.
- What?

00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:24.077
Rahul is going to meet Rashmi.
- Yes.

00:19:24.157 --> 00:19:25.177
But..
- But..

00:19:25.257 --> 00:19:26.733
Not the real Rahul.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:29.290
Fake Rahul Kitturkar.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.410
He should be so dangerous
that Rashmi..

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:34.723
..shouldn't even mention
Rahul's name.

00:19:35.423 --> 00:19:37.855
Do you know any such boy? Yes?

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:40.090
Dangerous?

00:19:41.038 --> 00:19:43.057
Bandya.
- Bandya?

00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:47.938
(Music)

00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:12.257
"This is love. This is love."

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.523
"This is love. This is love."

00:20:16.223 --> 00:20:19.323
"This is love. This is love."

00:20:19.937 --> 00:20:23.157
"This is love. This is love."

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:30.739
"Don't pine me. Come
and kiss me."

00:20:34.855 --> 00:20:41.790
"Your charm makes my
heart skip a beat."

00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:49.190
"Don't pine me. Come
and kiss me."

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.490
"Your charm makes my
heart skip a beat."

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.090
"Come, dear. I don't want
to live without you."

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.190
"This craving makes
me restless."

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.510
"This is the spell
of your love."

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.190
"This is the spell
of your love."

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.677
"This is the spell of your love.

00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:18.090
This is the spell of your love."

00:21:19.008 --> 00:21:22.797
(Music)

00:21:37.257 --> 00:21:44.757
"When you touch me,
a desire is aroused."

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:55.843
"When you touch me,
a desire is aroused."

00:21:55.923 --> 00:22:02.857
"I can't ever forget your
enchanting beauty."

00:22:02.937 --> 00:22:06.443
"Come, dear. I don't want
to live without you."

00:22:06.523 --> 00:22:10.410
"This craving makes
me restless."

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.843
"This is the spell
of your love."

00:22:13.923 --> 00:22:17.457
"This is the spell
of your love."

00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:21.301
"This is the spell of your love.

00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:24.391
This is the spell of your love."

00:22:25.317 --> 00:22:30.350
(Music)

00:22:40.052 --> 00:22:42.790
"This is love."

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:46.590
"This is love."

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:54.857
"I've gone crazy after seeing
you, queen of beauty."

00:22:58.611 --> 00:23:05.810
"I've gone crazy after seeing
you, queen of beauty."

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:12.743
"Will you keep me the
joy of the world?"

00:23:12.823 --> 00:23:16.443
"Come, dear. I don't want
to live without you."

00:23:16.523 --> 00:23:20.443
"This craving makes
me restless."

00:23:20.523 --> 00:23:23.957
"This is the spell
of your love."

00:23:24.037 --> 00:23:27.676
"This is the spell
of your love."

00:23:27.756 --> 00:23:31.370
"This is the spell of your love.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.123
This is the spell of your love."

00:23:37.314 --> 00:23:40.453
"This is love. This is love."

00:23:56.122 --> 00:23:58.007
You've to do just that.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.207
What are you saying?

00:24:00.786 --> 00:24:02.447
Is this appropriate?
- Meaning?

00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:07.142
You're the first father who
wants to get your daughter wooed!

00:24:07.222 --> 00:24:09.385
I didn't say that. Don't
talk rubbish!

00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:10.498
Mind your language.

00:24:10.598 --> 00:24:12.433
Mind your language! What
are you saying?

00:24:12.632 --> 00:24:14.298
Dhodhapkar, where
did you find him?

00:24:14.398 --> 00:24:15.818
I'm going.
- Listen.

00:24:15.898 --> 00:24:17.418
Talk to me properly.
- Ok.

00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:19.032
He's right, brother.

00:24:19.398 --> 00:24:23.265
He wants you to create hatred
for you in his daughter's heart.

00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:25.652
She shouldn't see you again.

00:24:25.732 --> 00:24:28.152
Me? But what relation
I've with her?

00:24:28.232 --> 00:24:31.185
No you, you should go
as Rahul Kitturkar.

00:24:31.265 --> 00:24:32.332
Ok.

00:24:33.398 --> 00:24:34.598
It's a matter of love.

00:24:35.032 --> 00:24:36.065
Problem of love!

00:24:36.165 --> 00:24:38.829
No. There will be problem
if they fall in love.

00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:41.595
But what's the boy's fault?

00:24:41.675 --> 00:24:44.232
He's a stupid fool!

00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:46.918
Just like his dad. Apple doesn't
fall far from tree.

00:24:46.998 --> 00:24:47.782
Dhodhapkar.

00:24:47.862 --> 00:24:48.518
(Laughs)

00:24:48.598 --> 00:24:51.232
No, I mean.. this is
a case of slyness.

00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:52.998
I find him sly.

00:24:53.536 --> 00:24:55.056
You're right.
- Dhodhapkar.

00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:56.823
It's no wrong. Remember
one thing.

00:24:56.903 --> 00:25:00.636
We shouldn't hide anything from
doctor, lawyer and don.

00:25:00.822 --> 00:25:02.036
Ok.

00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:03.495
Ok, take this.

00:25:04.023 --> 00:25:06.770
She'll be carrying a gift
wrapped in blue paper.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.470
You should just go and exchange
gifts. That's all.

00:25:10.777 --> 00:25:14.540
Why?
- Actually 24 years ago, this Anant..

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.341
(Clears throat)

00:25:15.421 --> 00:25:16.903
Dhodhapkar, shut up!
- Ok.

00:25:16.983 --> 00:25:18.180
Do as I say.
- Ok.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.670
Don't ask other question?

00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:21.136
Ok.

00:25:21.216 --> 00:25:23.103
Give me advance.
- Ok.

00:25:23.326 --> 00:25:27.123
But somehow stop brother
and sister from meeting.

00:25:27.203 --> 00:25:28.236
Brother and sister.

00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:32.723
No, he means brother (don),
protect the sister.

00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:36.123
Ok. Brother (don) should protect
the sister. Right?

00:25:36.203 --> 00:25:37.236
Yes, right.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.023
Take money. Evening at 6 pm
at Sixth Sense Mall. Ok?

00:25:43.103 --> 00:25:44.223
Let's go.
- Ok.

00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:45.336
Give it to him.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.438
You're taking the cups too.
- No.

00:25:47.906 --> 00:25:49.036
Come. Come.

00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:56.470
Gift?

00:25:57.211 --> 00:25:58.303
What gift?

00:25:58.403 --> 00:25:59.589
Dad had sent it.

00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:02.203
Dad? Where and when?

00:26:03.092 --> 00:26:04.203
Forget it.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.503
Oh no! It had to break
down today.

00:26:16.244 --> 00:26:18.554
(Phone rings)

00:26:18.762 --> 00:26:20.070
It's Tanuja.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.459
Yes, Tanuja?
- Rahul, you were going to phone me.

00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:26.996
Ok. Tell me, where will we go?

00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:30.023
Sweetheart, it's not possible
to meet today.

00:26:30.103 --> 00:26:32.956
Rahul, you won't meet me
on your birthday.

00:26:33.036 --> 00:26:36.556
Actually I've to go for an
urgent meeting with father.

00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:39.043
We'll celebrate tomorrow.
Please try to understand.

00:26:39.336 --> 00:26:41.723
Father came. I've to go.
I'll call you later.

00:26:41.803 --> 00:26:43.107
Ok, bye.

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:46.852
Your daughter has grown so big.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.367
She was small when she was a kid.
- Kids are small.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.436
Where is Bandya?
- I don't know.

00:26:55.536 --> 00:26:58.756
But what if Rahul comes before Bandya.
- Don't say that.

00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:00.637
Rahul won't come. I've
arranged that.

00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:04.190
(Gasps)

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.036
What happened?
- Look, Rahul has come.

00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:10.056
(Laughs)

00:27:10.136 --> 00:27:12.290
He has grown so big.
Hair has turned grey.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.816
He looks like a villager.

00:27:17.716 --> 00:27:19.074
Fool, that's the taxi driver.

00:27:19.154 --> 00:27:21.036
Can't you see the
boy next to him?

00:27:22.503 --> 00:27:23.536
Now what?

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.103
Now what?

00:27:48.203 --> 00:27:49.270
Now what?

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.103
Hi!

00:27:51.475 --> 00:27:53.590
Tanuja! What are you doing here?

00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:55.756
Really? What are you doing here?

00:27:55.836 --> 00:27:57.588
You'd an urgent meeting.
- Yes.

00:27:57.668 --> 00:28:01.040
But actually..
- Oh! Dating!

00:28:01.404 --> 00:28:03.471
With whom?
- Are you mad?

00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:06.766
Will I look at any other girl
besides you? Is it possible?

00:28:07.024 --> 00:28:08.711
You're avoiding me
on your birthday.

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.911
I won't leave you today. Come.
- Tanu..

00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:12.124
Please listen.
- Come.

00:28:12.204 --> 00:28:13.577
It's not so.
- Really?

00:28:13.657 --> 00:28:16.157
Listen to me.
- No.

00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:18.036
(Sighs)

00:28:18.424 --> 00:28:20.777
He left.
- Who was the girl? - I don't know.

00:28:20.857 --> 00:28:22.177
But she came like an angel.

00:28:22.257 --> 00:28:25.031
Anant, your son is
just like you.

00:28:26.557 --> 00:28:28.744
It's important that problem is over.
- Yes.

00:28:28.824 --> 00:28:30.624
Should we stop Bandya?
- No.

00:28:30.924 --> 00:28:33.191
Let her detest Rahul.

00:28:33.457 --> 00:28:35.511
I don't want this trouble again.
- Don't worry.

00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:38.611
Bandya will make her hate Rahul.

00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:41.006
She won't remember Rahul again.

00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:43.824
You said correct for the first time.
- It's out of question.

00:28:57.391 --> 00:28:58.944
Are you looking so someone?

00:29:00.591 --> 00:29:01.624
What's this?

00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:03.424
What are police?

00:29:03.524 --> 00:29:04.557
They're my boys.

00:29:05.017 --> 00:29:06.111
Your boys are police?

00:29:06.191 --> 00:29:07.944
It's my gang.
- Oh!

00:29:08.024 --> 00:29:09.315
Why did you come late?

00:29:09.826 --> 00:29:11.077
The work isn't so simple.

00:29:11.157 --> 00:29:12.791
I've a plan to create
bad impression..

00:29:12.891 --> 00:29:16.711
..in front of your daughter.
- You made the plan. So come now.

00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:18.244
Where is the gift box?

00:29:18.324 --> 00:29:20.644
Hey, don't talk to me like
this or we're leaving.

00:29:20.724 --> 00:29:22.696
Wait! Wait!

00:29:23.324 --> 00:29:24.773
Where is the gift box?

00:29:25.357 --> 00:29:27.549
Are these eyes or just drawings?

00:29:27.757 --> 00:29:29.144
Tell him..
- Can't you see?

00:29:29.224 --> 00:29:30.357
It's there.

00:29:31.424 --> 00:29:33.411
Hurry up. It's getting late.

00:29:33.491 --> 00:29:34.863
Bandya.
- Speak like that.

00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:37.425
Bandya.
- Come on. - Come.

00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:05.957
Come.

00:30:08.657 --> 00:30:10.544
What's your name?

00:30:11.556 --> 00:30:13.174
Rahul Kitturkar.

00:30:17.047 --> 00:30:19.520
Who? Rahul Kitturkar.

00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:22.538
Yes. Rahul Kitturkar.

00:30:22.857 --> 00:30:24.839
Who? Tell us.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.813
Are you Rahul Kitturkar?

00:30:28.147 --> 00:30:32.164
Should I scream that
I'm Rahul Kitturkar?

00:30:32.244 --> 00:30:34.810
You fight? You bully around?

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.108
You committed theft!

00:30:39.647 --> 00:30:42.180
Whack this fool!

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.313
Hit him!

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.880
Now what?

00:30:47.532 --> 00:30:48.647
Hit him!

00:30:49.261 --> 00:30:50.705
Slowly!

00:30:53.031 --> 00:30:54.313
Hey, you..

00:30:54.511 --> 00:30:55.613
Slowly!

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.747
Now what?

00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:16.093
Brother, what happened?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.733
What's going on? Let's check it.

00:31:18.813 --> 00:31:21.099
What happened, brother?
Why are you hitting us?

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.400
Stop! Smarty, you're hitting
police! Who are you?

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.106
No. Listen to me, sir.

00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:34.433
Sir, I'm Rahul Kitturkar.
It's not my fault.

00:31:34.513 --> 00:31:35.845
Sir, they're goons.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.380
Goons? Really?
- Yes.

00:31:39.547 --> 00:31:42.867
You call police goons.
- Sir, they're not police.

00:31:42.947 --> 00:31:45.515
Ask them if they've
ID cards. Ask them.

00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:47.647
Where is your ID card?
- He has it.

00:31:47.747 --> 00:31:50.780
No, he has it.
- It must be having it.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.933
No, sir. He has it.
- It's ID card..

00:31:53.013 --> 00:31:54.433
..or coupon.

00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:56.347
Sir, they're fake.

00:31:56.813 --> 00:31:59.733
Let's go. - Fake?
- Yes. - Fake.

00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:01.813
Let's run!
- Sir, they're fake.

00:33:09.293 --> 00:33:10.279

00:37:16.646 --> 00:37:17.680
Bye.
- Bye.

00:37:27.413 --> 00:37:29.700
I can't believe we met
coincidentally..

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.574
..and in the first meeting..

00:37:31.654 --> 00:37:33.080
I too can't believe it.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.380
Rashmi, it happened because
of your father.

00:37:38.168 --> 00:37:39.846
How is he related to it?

00:37:43.459 --> 00:37:44.813
Relationship?

00:37:46.646 --> 00:37:48.019
There is a relationship.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.513
Your father's name is
Anant Kitturkar..

00:37:50.613 --> 00:37:52.725
..and my father's name too
is Anant Kitturkar.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.866
That's why this started

00:37:54.946 --> 00:37:58.213
Yes. - And your father sired
you that's why we met.

00:37:58.357 --> 00:37:59.582
(Laughs)

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.346
I love your sense of humour.

00:38:01.575 --> 00:38:03.213
I love everything about you.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.180
Great! So coy!

00:38:07.513 --> 00:38:08.580
Amazing!

00:38:09.213 --> 00:38:11.346
Ok, bye.
- Bye.

00:38:12.013 --> 00:38:13.441
Bye.
- Bye.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.417
Bye.
- Bye.

00:38:17.313 --> 00:38:18.346
Bye.

00:38:20.513 --> 00:38:21.546
Yes!

00:38:23.446 --> 00:38:24.546
Stop.

00:38:24.946 --> 00:38:26.180
Shut up! Leave me.

00:38:27.313 --> 00:38:30.643
Listen. You're trying to trap
my daughter in your love.

00:38:31.246 --> 00:38:32.313
How dare you!

00:38:33.113 --> 00:38:34.594
Did you forget out deal?

00:38:35.604 --> 00:38:37.266
Our had a deal.
- Yes.

00:38:37.346 --> 00:38:40.136
But what can I do if she
gave me her heart?

00:38:40.503 --> 00:38:42.249
I can't help that we're
in love. Right?

00:38:42.329 --> 00:38:43.900
Right?
- It just happened.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.646
What?
- Yes. - Forgot our deal?

00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:48.133
You told me to get
into her head.

00:38:48.213 --> 00:38:51.732
But she entered my heart.
So what can I do?

00:38:52.113 --> 00:38:55.066
Scum! Lowly!
- What should I do to him? - Nothing.

00:38:55.146 --> 00:38:57.500
I'll strangle you.
- Really? - Yes.

00:38:57.683 --> 00:38:59.282
You'll strange me?
- Yes.

00:39:00.098 --> 00:39:02.013
You'll make your daughter
a widow before marriage.

00:39:02.113 --> 00:39:03.666
Are you a father or a butcher?

00:39:03.746 --> 00:39:05.594
No matter what, I'm her father.

00:39:05.674 --> 00:39:09.154
You've no relationship with her.
- Why not?

00:39:09.576 --> 00:39:11.146
We're in love.

00:39:11.596 --> 00:39:12.900
I'm going to marry Rashmi.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.033
Marriage?
- Yes. - Get lost.

00:39:15.113 --> 00:39:18.133
It's not possible even in 7 births.
- Forget 7 births.

00:39:18.213 --> 00:39:20.307
I'll marry Rashmi
in this lifetime.

00:39:20.695 --> 00:39:22.780
Just try to even look at her.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.274
Sorry. I erred.

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.128
I won't look at her.

00:39:27.663 --> 00:39:30.549
I'll close my eyes and settle
a family with her.

00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:31.829
Ok?
- Family.

00:39:32.263 --> 00:39:34.745
Don't dream. I won't
spare you alive.

00:39:35.529 --> 00:39:37.664
You don't know me yet.
Remember that?

00:39:42.098 --> 00:39:43.229
I'm not scared.

00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:47.963
Listen, Mr. Kitturkar.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:54.393
You're Rashmi's father that's
why I heard all this.

00:39:55.196 --> 00:39:57.569
You too don't know me yet.
- Really?

00:39:57.763 --> 00:40:00.228
I'll tell Rashmi your
truth right away.

00:40:00.308 --> 00:40:01.995
Come. I'll come too. Let's go.

00:40:02.075 --> 00:40:04.961
I'll tell your two wives
and two children..

00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:07.441
..that Anant Kitturkar
isn't two, but one.

00:40:07.747 --> 00:40:09.141
Let's go. Are you coming?

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:12.475
Dhodhapkar.

00:40:13.308 --> 00:40:15.061
I didn't tell him.

00:40:15.141 --> 00:40:17.541
Hey! It's not his fault.

00:40:18.108 --> 00:40:21.841
Before doing any job,
I find all the details.

00:40:22.381 --> 00:40:23.709
Yes. It's my style.

00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:28.028
Now tell me. Should I tell them?

00:40:31.175 --> 00:40:33.175
What can I say between
relatives?

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:35.480
I'm after all an outsider.

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:37.977
Yes, he has a point.

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:47.428
Hey, Bandya! What have you done?

00:40:47.508 --> 00:40:49.841
Anant is like a snake.

00:40:50.875 --> 00:40:52.808
If he's snake, I'm
a snake charmer.

00:40:53.408 --> 00:40:56.608
I'll make him dance to my tune.

00:40:57.348 --> 00:40:58.559
Let's go. Sit.

00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:01.708
Today is program.

00:41:03.275 --> 00:41:04.975
I'm going to meet Sharmila.

00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:08.608
Want to meet her?

00:41:09.808 --> 00:41:10.841
Let's go.

00:41:11.075 --> 00:41:13.641
Wait. Wait a minute.

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:17.875
Actually my right leg
is weak. Move on.

00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:25.275
What should I say to her?
- No need. She has decided it.

00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:28.328
I'll be free too once
she gets married.

00:41:28.408 --> 00:41:30.750
You'll get free, but she'll
be stuck for life.

00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:33.317
Think of her and
not of yourself.

00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:34.928
I'm thought about it.

00:41:35.008 --> 00:41:37.075
You want to marry
him because his..

00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:39.061
..father's name is same as mine.

00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:40.175
No.

00:41:40.783 --> 00:41:43.008
Rahul is smart and dashing!

00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:46.708
He's from a rich family
yet he has no attitude.

00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:48.361
His attitude!

00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:50.428
You've gone mad in her love.

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:52.408
You won't know dashing.

00:41:52.508 --> 00:41:53.541
Shut up!

00:41:53.825 --> 00:41:56.450
Father, have you met him?

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.997
No. Then why do you object.
- You're right.

00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:02.150
Rashmi, don't listen to him.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.492
He has lost his mind.

00:42:03.672 --> 00:42:05.530
He's used to finding faults
in everything.

00:42:06.264 --> 00:42:09.137
Listen to me and call Rahul.

00:42:09.317 --> 00:42:13.584
At least we'll get to meet two
Anant Kitturkar together. - Really?

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:14.730
Thank you.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.361
Two Kitturkar don't exist.
How can he bring him?

00:42:18.907 --> 00:42:20.430
He'll get caught.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.494
Phone him. I'll talk to him.

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:24.150
(Gasps)

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.730
Father, I love you.
Just a minute.

00:42:25.895 --> 00:42:28.184
Bandya, you betrayed us!

00:42:28.264 --> 00:42:29.297
I betrayed you!

00:42:29.497 --> 00:42:33.317
I told you to act, but you
started over-acting. - Over acting.

00:42:33.397 --> 00:42:34.752
You hit me so bad.

00:42:34.832 --> 00:42:36.550
You deserve it.
- (Phone rings)

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.859
It's true.

00:42:38.433 --> 00:42:40.184
Rashmi's phone.

00:42:40.264 --> 00:42:41.706
Excuse me. I'll be back.

00:42:42.564 --> 00:42:44.494
Hi, Rashmi.
- Hi, Rahul.

00:42:44.697 --> 00:42:45.730
What's up?

00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:48.259
Listen, father wants
to talk to you.

00:42:48.464 --> 00:42:50.864
Father.. yes, sure.
Put him on the line.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.026
What?
- Look..

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:54.950
What's do you want? Get lost.

00:42:55.269 --> 00:42:56.064
Yes.

00:42:56.164 --> 00:43:00.369
Hello, son Rahul.
This is Anant Kitturkar.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.350
Yes, father-in-law.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.943
Rashmi was praising you.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:11.040
I've a praise-worthy personality
that's why Rashmi fell in love with me.

00:43:11.397 --> 00:43:14.786
Father-in-law, you've got a one
in a million son-in-law.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.084
Right.

00:43:17.164 --> 00:43:18.730
What? Get going.

00:43:20.697 --> 00:43:22.208
We'll see later.

00:43:22.564 --> 00:43:24.907
But we want to meet you.
- Best.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.706
Don't delay good deed.
I'll come right away.

00:43:27.786 --> 00:43:29.084
We'll fix the marriage.

00:43:29.164 --> 00:43:30.664
Right?
- Yeah!

00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:33.467
I'll pelt you!

00:43:35.344 --> 00:43:39.798
We'll surely meet. But don't
forget to bring your parents.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.564
Parents?

00:43:41.664 --> 00:43:45.973
I want to meet industrialist
Anant Kitturkar.

00:43:46.053 --> 00:43:49.442
Look, father-in-law.
There is a problem.

00:43:50.164 --> 00:43:51.717
Don't drag the matter.

00:43:51.797 --> 00:43:55.194
You've started it. So everything
should be discussed now.

00:43:55.522 --> 00:43:58.397
I've to check everything. We're
from the girl's side.

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:01.050
You're from the girl's side.
Try to give some ground.

00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:04.370
Don't talk of parents.
Please listen to me.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:09.784
Do come at 10 am tomorrow with
your parents for sure.

00:44:09.864 --> 00:44:11.966
Ok, bye.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.370
Hello. Hello.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.169
What happened, Bandya? Ah?

00:44:21.477 --> 00:44:22.777
Where to get parents from?

00:44:23.677 --> 00:44:24.711
Parents?

00:44:25.677 --> 00:44:29.164
If father finds out that
I'm getting married..

00:44:29.244 --> 00:44:31.531
Father! Father!
- What are you doing?

00:44:31.611 --> 00:44:32.844
You're bothering me..

00:44:32.924 --> 00:44:34.077
Will you keep quiet?

00:44:34.177 --> 00:44:35.997
You keep quiet! You've
pampered him.

00:44:36.077 --> 00:44:40.131
Father, don't force me.
- Shut up!

00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:42.813
How can I refuse Mr. Rao now?

00:44:43.211 --> 00:44:45.164
The way you accepted it.

00:44:45.244 --> 00:44:46.744
I'll slap you, Bandya.

00:44:46.824 --> 00:44:47.863
(Gunshot)

00:44:50.511 --> 00:44:53.611
Abba, don't dare to refuse me.

00:44:53.877 --> 00:44:55.644
I'll shoot you.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.777
I'm Mr. Rao Hande Patil.
I don't like rejection.

00:44:58.857 --> 00:45:00.011
Accept it.

00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:02.197
Who is refusing? Please
calm down.

00:45:02.277 --> 00:45:03.463
Give me the gun.

00:45:03.921 --> 00:45:05.694
(Crying)

00:45:07.544 --> 00:45:10.964
Dear, why are you crying?
We're here.

00:45:11.044 --> 00:45:14.397
Please calm down. I'm telling
you they'll get married.

00:45:14.477 --> 00:45:16.731
I won't marry.

00:45:16.811 --> 00:45:19.731
Even your father will marry her.
- Go ahead. - Sure.

00:45:19.811 --> 00:45:23.564
What? - I mean we'll fix their
engagement tomorrow for sure.

00:45:23.644 --> 00:45:24.280
No, father.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.540
(Bandya) 'I decided I won't stay there.'

00:45:27.048 --> 00:45:29.711
'I took the bus to
Mumbai next day.'

00:45:32.057 --> 00:45:33.822
How can I get parents now?

00:45:34.534 --> 00:45:36.915
Industrialist Anant Kitturkar.

00:45:49.902 --> 00:45:50.877
Father-in-law.

00:45:52.677 --> 00:45:58.577
I've a befitting reply
to your every ruse.

00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:01.333
I'm Bandya.

00:46:02.877 --> 00:46:04.464
Why are you reading newspaper.

00:46:04.544 --> 00:46:06.339
Get to work.
- Guests are coming.

00:46:06.419 --> 00:46:09.131
That fool won't come.
I can assure you.

00:46:09.297 --> 00:46:12.212
I don't know why you're angry
on that poor Rahul.

00:46:12.292 --> 00:46:15.136
Poor! He's a loafer.

00:46:16.488 --> 00:46:19.071
May I come in?
- No, wait.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.455
Where are your parents?

00:46:23.332 --> 00:46:24.388
Father.

00:46:24.468 --> 00:46:25.418
(Father coughs)

00:46:25.498 --> 00:46:26.522
Please come.

00:46:29.322 --> 00:46:31.588
Greetings. I'm Anant Kitturkar.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.855
Dhodhapkar, you?

00:46:36.616 --> 00:46:38.131
Mr. Anant Rao Kitturkar.

00:46:38.555 --> 00:46:39.588
My father.

00:46:39.822 --> 00:46:45.142
And my mother Anjali Kitturkar's husband.
- Anju Darling.

00:46:45.312 --> 00:46:46.575
You..
- What is it? - What?

00:46:46.655 --> 00:46:48.408
Don't make guests stand
at the door.

00:46:48.488 --> 00:46:49.521
Please come in.
- Come, father.

00:46:49.601 --> 00:46:51.358
Guests have come.
- (Rashmi) Coming.

00:46:51.974 --> 00:46:53.222
I'll show you.

00:47:01.855 --> 00:47:02.855
Oh dear!

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.435
Come in, son-in-law.

00:47:07.788 --> 00:47:09.030
What are you doing?

00:47:09.222 --> 00:47:10.407
Listen..
- What?

00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:14.608
I think sir didn't like
our coming here.

00:47:14.688 --> 00:47:15.835
No.
- Hi.

00:47:15.915 --> 00:47:16.822
Hi.

00:47:17.679 --> 00:47:21.122
Who will like if goons like
you come to their houses?

00:47:21.457 --> 00:47:23.406
Name must be same, but
what about the status?

00:47:23.486 --> 00:47:24.653
What are you saying?

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.486
Is this the way to
talk to guests?

00:47:26.771 --> 00:47:29.286
We're from girl's side.
- I know, that you I said it. Quiet!

00:47:29.786 --> 00:47:31.773
I should be quiet!
You're telling me.

00:47:31.853 --> 00:47:32.908
Are you mad?

00:47:32.988 --> 00:47:34.273
(Laughs)
- Shut up!

00:47:34.353 --> 00:47:37.289
Who won't go mad looking
at such a lowly man?

00:47:37.538 --> 00:47:40.797
Cheat, traitor and alcoholic!
Rahul's father.

00:47:41.086 --> 00:47:42.382
Rahul's father is like this!

00:47:42.462 --> 00:47:44.098
He drinks and lies on road.

00:47:44.178 --> 00:47:45.046
(Gasps)

00:47:46.086 --> 00:47:47.260
He used to.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.253
He used to. I was way back.

00:47:49.586 --> 00:47:52.740
He hasn't even touched a drop
of liquor for years now.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.914
It's been 40 years.
- Yes.

00:47:55.586 --> 00:47:56.606
40 years?
- Yes.

00:47:56.686 --> 00:47:58.096
How old are you?
- 39.

00:47:58.176 --> 00:47:59.023
(Bandya clears throat)

00:47:59.286 --> 00:48:00.440
45.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.586
45?

00:48:02.086 --> 00:48:03.531
It means when he was 5..

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.673
At the age of 5. Yes.

00:48:05.753 --> 00:48:10.406
Actually when he was 5,
granny know his vices.

00:48:10.486 --> 00:48:13.996
So she didn't even let him
touch a drop of liquor.

00:48:14.076 --> 00:48:15.248
She gave him bottle.

00:48:15.973 --> 00:48:17.220
Saw?
- Of milk.

00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:19.320
Saw?

00:48:19.553 --> 00:48:20.833
Let it be.

00:48:20.913 --> 00:48:23.340
Thank God he quit drinking.
- Completely. - It's good.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.584
But your mother didn't come.

00:48:26.253 --> 00:48:29.475
Where is she? Where is your mother?

00:48:30.186 --> 00:48:31.173
Where?

00:48:31.253 --> 00:48:32.870
She'll come.
- When?

00:48:33.753 --> 00:48:36.153
That.. she'll be here.
- But when?

00:48:37.286 --> 00:48:38.353
Mother.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.453
Come.

00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:47.520
(Yawns)

00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.786
Oh dear!

00:48:54.253 --> 00:48:55.320
Look!

00:48:55.953 --> 00:48:56.986
You look!

00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.853
Hi, guys.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.862
Come, mother.

00:49:08.186 --> 00:49:09.786
She looks so nice!

00:49:09.886 --> 00:49:10.920
Come.

00:49:11.294 --> 00:49:12.894
Please sit.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.219
Sit.
- No please.

00:49:15.676 --> 00:49:16.820
If I sit, I'll fall asleep.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.740
You do your work quickly.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.679
I danced whole night,
so my feet are..

00:49:22.215 --> 00:49:23.440
Exhausted!

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.720
She dances whole night.

00:49:24.986 --> 00:49:27.145
She dances! Saw?

00:49:27.664 --> 00:49:29.300
So what?

00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:33.233
For work she has to go around.
That's called dancing.

00:49:33.313 --> 00:49:38.620
She has to meet different
type of people..

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.853
..that's why her language
has been ruined.

00:49:40.933 --> 00:49:42.641
My child!
- Enough!

00:49:42.721 --> 00:49:45.000
Your mother-in-law is so hard working.

00:49:45.298 --> 00:49:47.633
You'll be her daughter-in-law. Greet her.
- Ok.

00:49:48.006 --> 00:49:49.033
Greetings.

00:49:49.606 --> 00:49:51.638
(Whistles)

00:49:52.209 --> 00:49:53.367
Bandya.

00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:57.633
What a great item you've
found, pal!

00:49:57.882 --> 00:49:59.387
Absolutely superb!

00:49:59.467 --> 00:50:00.500
Right.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.900
What's right?
- This..

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:03.867
Bandya.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.833
Saw? His name is Bandya,
not Rahul.

00:50:07.533 --> 00:50:10.767
No. It means my real
name is Rahul..

00:50:11.183 --> 00:50:13.440
..but mother calls me
Bandya with love.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.200
So what? Didn't you mother
used to call you Dhondiya?

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.353
(Laughs)

00:50:18.433 --> 00:50:20.000
Listen!
- Shut up!

00:50:21.508 --> 00:50:22.633
Can you dance?

00:50:22.935 --> 00:50:24.533
Dear, salsa!

00:50:24.633 --> 00:50:27.163
My daughter isn't interested in
such cheap profession. - Father.

00:50:27.867 --> 00:50:28.900
I'll learn.

00:50:30.767 --> 00:50:33.300
Mother-in-law is great,
you too should learn.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.120
My life got wasted.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.300
She'll dance.
- What dance!

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.851
Bandya, give me a green note.

00:50:40.242 --> 00:50:41.153
Why?

00:50:41.233 --> 00:50:42.487
Give me.

00:50:42.567 --> 00:50:44.087
She means betel leaf.

00:50:44.167 --> 00:50:45.400
You keep them anywhere.

00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:46.867
It's here.

00:50:49.367 --> 00:50:52.067
God save you from evil eyes!

00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:53.753
Take this.
- Thank you.

00:50:53.833 --> 00:50:56.165
Don't take it with hands.

00:50:57.833 --> 00:50:59.067
Take it with your mouth.

00:50:59.633 --> 00:51:00.667
Oh dear!

00:51:04.449 --> 00:51:05.638
Get back.

00:51:05.933 --> 00:51:06.967
What's going on!

00:51:07.167 --> 00:51:09.433
This is token on seeing the
face of daughter-in-law.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.670
And this is our custom!

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.687
It's very interesting.

00:51:15.767 --> 00:51:17.800
Her mother didn't know anything.
- What?

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.087
Rashmi, give him treat
in our style.

00:51:21.167 --> 00:51:22.431
Really?
- Yes.

00:51:24.333 --> 00:51:26.245
Not in front of everyone.

00:51:26.567 --> 00:51:27.600
No.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.396
She went to get sweets!
In front of everyone!

00:51:31.167 --> 00:51:32.567
She went to get sweets?
- Yes.

00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:35.249
So should I consider
this alliance fixed?

00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:37.529
Yes. Absolutely.
- Not at all.

00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:40.749
No, it's not possible.
- Why not?

00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:43.816
They've house in Malabar Hill.
They've an industry.

00:51:43.896 --> 00:51:45.303
What do they lack?

00:51:45.383 --> 00:51:47.796
I'll tell you what
the problem is.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.196
He feels inferiority complex.

00:51:50.276 --> 00:51:52.196
Inferiority complex.
- Yes. Listen..

00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:56.832
Look at your status and our status.
- Right.

00:51:56.912 --> 00:52:00.449
Father-in-law, don't worry
about the status.

00:52:00.529 --> 00:52:03.462
We accept your daughter
in any condition.

00:52:03.682 --> 00:52:06.829
Heard him!
- We'll spend more.

00:52:07.055 --> 00:52:08.129
Right, dad?

00:52:08.209 --> 00:52:09.624
We'll spend. We don't care.

00:52:09.704 --> 00:52:12.782
I won't spend money. I can
afford it. I'm telling you.

00:52:12.862 --> 00:52:14.616
Hear this pauper industrialist.

00:52:14.696 --> 00:52:16.096
Saw?
- What?

00:52:16.594 --> 00:52:18.182
What to see?
- I asked the same. - (Yawns)

00:52:18.262 --> 00:52:20.696
What do you mean?
- Whom are you talking to?

00:52:20.776 --> 00:52:24.149
Dad has transferred all the
money in my account.

00:52:24.229 --> 00:52:26.780
Dear!
- I see all the deals.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:27.816
Saw?
- Right.

00:52:27.896 --> 00:52:29.671
Right, mom?
- (Yawns)

00:52:30.129 --> 00:52:31.696
I'm feeling sleepy.

00:52:31.996 --> 00:52:35.282
Just a minute. Before sleeping
have some sweets.

00:52:35.362 --> 00:52:37.662
Rashmi, bring sweets.

00:52:37.742 --> 00:52:38.962
Hurry up!

00:52:39.529 --> 00:52:40.596
Bring it.

00:52:41.547 --> 00:52:43.060
Have sweets.

00:52:43.666 --> 00:52:46.296
Now consider this
alliance fixed.

00:52:46.662 --> 00:52:48.462
Leave me.
- It's fixed.

00:52:48.862 --> 00:52:51.745
Father-in-law, have some sweets.

00:52:54.796 --> 00:52:55.829
One all.

00:52:57.062 --> 00:52:58.796
(Anant) Cheat! Scum!
- (Dhodhapkar) Anant.

00:52:59.062 --> 00:53:01.282
(Dhodhapkar) Anant.
- (Anant) You're a traitor.

00:53:01.362 --> 00:53:04.049
(Dhodhapkar) Anant, you always think of
yourself. Look at this Bandya.

00:53:04.129 --> 00:53:08.649
He's a foe, yet he promised to
get me married to Sharmila.

00:53:08.729 --> 00:53:10.549
That's why you became
his fake father.

00:53:10.629 --> 00:53:12.609
For Sharmila I can do anything.

00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:14.484
Ok.
- (Laughs)

00:53:15.129 --> 00:53:16.162
Now tell me.

00:53:16.462 --> 00:53:17.962
Ok. Fine.

00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:20.090
We're no more friends.

00:53:20.529 --> 00:53:22.016
Henceforth don't meet me alone.

00:53:22.096 --> 00:53:27.749
If I see you alone, that'll be
the last day of your life.

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:29.465
Don't meet me alone.

00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:47.727
You've been under stress
for the past few days.

00:53:48.656 --> 00:53:49.761
Is there a problem?

00:53:51.614 --> 00:53:53.694
It's nothing like that, but..

00:53:53.994 --> 00:53:57.381
..I've to handle this big
business that's why..

00:53:57.461 --> 00:53:58.647
..I get some problems.

00:53:58.727 --> 00:54:01.627
That's why I tell you to involve
Rahul in your affairs.

00:54:02.661 --> 00:54:05.062
I mean, in your business.
He's not a kid anymore.

00:54:06.801 --> 00:54:07.647
Where is he?

00:54:07.727 --> 00:54:10.200
What's your father's name?

00:54:10.361 --> 00:54:11.427
Anant Kitturkar.

00:54:12.694 --> 00:54:14.576
Keep the snacks down.

00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:16.681
Father.
- Anant Kitturkar?

00:54:16.761 --> 00:54:19.004
That pauper! You're his son.

00:54:19.294 --> 00:54:21.374
Get out. I say get out.

00:54:21.861 --> 00:54:24.881
Father. - What happened?
Do you know my father?

00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:27.647
I know him well. He used
to work for me.

00:54:27.727 --> 00:54:30.014
It's before you were born.

00:54:30.094 --> 00:54:34.216
What are you saying?
- He's a worthless chap!

00:54:34.494 --> 00:54:37.097
He didn't take work seriously.
He made mistakes.

00:54:37.461 --> 00:54:40.447
He told me he didn't want to
work, but do business..

00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:42.674
..so he begged for money.

00:54:43.427 --> 00:54:45.858
I thought of helping a man
from our community..

00:54:45.938 --> 00:54:49.181
..so I gave him Rs. 10,000 at that time.

00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:52.059
Rs.10,000?
- Yes.

00:54:52.627 --> 00:54:57.261
That scum went to bar and spend
my hard earned money.

00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:03.033
No. I won't let my daughter
marry in such a lowly man's house.

00:55:03.371 --> 00:55:04.642
It's the end.
- Father.

00:55:04.827 --> 00:55:06.947
You're surely mistaken.

00:55:07.027 --> 00:55:10.827
Mistaken! Is your mother's
name Manorama.

00:55:11.562 --> 00:55:12.737
You've a sister?

00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:14.511
No, I'm the only child.

00:55:15.261 --> 00:55:16.751
Manorama isn't my mother..

00:55:17.794 --> 00:55:20.098
Oh! Right. Right.

00:55:20.494 --> 00:55:22.485
Rashmi. Rashmi Kitturkar.

00:55:22.761 --> 00:55:25.147
Yes. That Anant Kitturkar
is Rashmi's father.

00:55:25.227 --> 00:55:26.394
He must've tricked you.

00:55:26.594 --> 00:55:29.381
He's not my father, but some
other Anant Kitturkar.

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.281
Yes, only names are same.

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:34.783
Two Anant Kitturkar
with same names.

00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:36.681
I don't believe it.

00:55:36.761 --> 00:55:38.527
Uncle, believe me.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.781
He must be someone else.

00:55:40.861 --> 00:55:42.082
He's not my father.

00:55:42.436 --> 00:55:43.655
I'm telling the truth.

00:55:44.125 --> 00:55:46.325
You're his only son, right?

00:55:46.656 --> 00:55:47.758
Yes. I swear.

00:55:48.749 --> 00:55:50.791
Father, Rahul never lies.

00:55:50.954 --> 00:55:52.958
I know him from inside out.
- Yes.

00:55:53.038 --> 00:55:53.877
(Coughs)

00:55:54.111 --> 00:55:55.191
Inside-out?

00:55:56.723 --> 00:55:58.391
I mean he's good at heart.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:00.727
He isn't what he looks like.

00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:03.325
He's so nice, so how can
his father be a cheat?

00:56:04.558 --> 00:56:08.225
It means you've no relation
with that pauper.

00:56:24.658 --> 00:56:27.258
Mother, open your eyes.

00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:30.858
Your daughter-in-law's snap
is in front of you.

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.058
Oh goddess!

00:56:36.904 --> 00:56:38.058
Yes.

00:56:38.525 --> 00:56:40.622
I'm happy with you.

00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:44.225
Your son's desires
are fulfilled.

00:56:45.425 --> 00:56:48.611
Now first making offering on
your daughter-in-law's..

00:56:48.856 --> 00:56:49.858
..behalf then mine.

00:56:50.858 --> 00:56:52.658
Bandya!
- Mother!

00:56:53.648 --> 00:56:55.558
Mother.
- You're kidding.

00:56:56.158 --> 00:56:58.879
You kidding with goddess!
- No, with you.

00:56:59.058 --> 00:57:01.292
You're kidding me! Aren't
you ashamed?

00:57:01.372 --> 00:57:02.442
(Laughs)

00:57:03.654 --> 00:57:06.011
Where were you for so many days?

00:57:06.091 --> 00:57:07.525
Forget me..

00:57:10.925 --> 00:57:12.691
..and look at your
daughter-in-law's snap.

00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:16.317
That's her.
- What?

00:57:16.825 --> 00:57:19.473
No. Very good. Nice girl. Good.

00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:21.745
What's her name?
- Tanuja.

00:57:21.825 --> 00:57:24.135
Tanuja. Nice name.
Did you see her?

00:57:24.291 --> 00:57:25.445
Yes, I saw the snap.

00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:27.595
And Rahul's choice can't
be wrong. I know.

00:57:28.225 --> 00:57:30.614
Is she final?
- Yes. What do you mean?

00:57:30.858 --> 00:57:33.178
We fixed it when we were in college.
- Ok.

00:57:33.258 --> 00:57:35.091
Then why were you flirting
with other girls?

00:57:35.658 --> 00:57:36.691
Which girl?

00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:38.291
Should I tell you?

00:57:38.391 --> 00:57:40.449
Let it be. This is
young generation.

00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:43.735
Dad, I like meeting girls
just for time pass.

00:57:44.072 --> 00:57:45.465
Ok. Time pass.

00:57:46.058 --> 00:57:48.125
If you hadn't gone
to meet Rashmi..

00:57:48.205 --> 00:57:49.911
..this wouldn't have happened.

00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:51.025
Stupid!

00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:56.258
What happened? What are you thinking?
Is there a problem?

00:57:56.358 --> 00:57:58.411
No, problem. We'll see her.

00:57:58.576 --> 00:58:00.971
Her father called you
tomorrow to meet him.

00:58:01.225 --> 00:58:03.384
What does her father do?
- He has a business.

00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:06.688
He owns Paranjpay tourism
and travel company.

00:58:09.458 --> 00:58:10.302
What happened?

00:58:10.382 --> 00:58:12.145
(Gunshot)
- (Dad) Bandya! - I'm doomed!

00:58:12.225 --> 00:58:13.978
Father came.
- (Dad) Bandya!

00:58:14.058 --> 00:58:17.011
I'll flee. I'll come to take you
when the wedding is fixed.

00:58:17.091 --> 00:58:18.678
But don't tell anyone anything.

00:58:18.758 --> 00:58:21.858
Start the bike quickly.
Dad has come.

00:58:22.247 --> 00:58:25.111
Ride, my dear. Hurry up!

00:58:25.191 --> 00:58:27.351
Hurry up!

00:58:27.567 --> 00:58:29.694
Come on, hurry up.

00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:34.458
Bandya! Bandya, stop!

00:58:34.624 --> 00:58:35.825
Bandya!

00:58:39.591 --> 00:58:42.001
Is this the way to drive?

00:58:42.358 --> 00:58:43.391
It's stuck.

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:47.325
What happened? It's stuck in pothole.

00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:50.991
What was he saying?

00:58:51.418 --> 00:58:53.642
Before saying anything he
fled when you screamed.

00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:55.132
Is it right?

00:58:55.212 --> 00:58:57.478
Where can he go? He
has to return.

00:58:57.578 --> 00:58:58.612
I won't spare him.

00:59:00.188 --> 00:59:03.998
This machine has let us down!
- What can we do with it? - What?

00:59:04.078 --> 00:59:06.045
Start it. Take it back. Come on.

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:10.178
God knows where he went?

00:59:20.578 --> 00:59:22.309
(Anant) 'Don't meet me alone.'

00:59:23.849 --> 00:59:26.778
Dhodhapkar. Listen.
Listen to me.

00:59:26.878 --> 00:59:29.265
Anant, this is wrong.

00:59:29.345 --> 00:59:30.844
It's not wrong. It's right.

00:59:30.924 --> 00:59:33.655
I tell you, everything is
fair in love and war.

00:59:33.735 --> 00:59:35.768
I apologize to you. I've erred.

00:59:35.868 --> 00:59:38.535
I don't love Sharmila.
I don't want to marry her.

00:59:38.615 --> 00:59:41.521
I won't become Anant
Kitturkar again.

00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:43.868
You've to become
Anant Kitturkar.

00:59:43.948 --> 00:59:47.821
No. I don't want to get involve in it.
- I made a mistake.

00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:49.388
Calm down.
- Ok.

00:59:49.468 --> 00:59:50.735
I won't do anything to you.

00:59:50.835 --> 00:59:53.255
We're old friends.
- Right.

00:59:53.335 --> 00:59:56.688
That's why I say, you've to
become Anant Kitturkar again.

00:59:56.768 --> 00:59:58.068
What?
- Yes. Listen.

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.521
My son Rahul loves a
girl named Tanuja.

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:02.655
Oh God!

01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:05.088
Is Tanuja your daughter too?
- No.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:07.288
She's not my daughter. She's
Mr. Paranjpay's daughter.

01:00:07.368 --> 01:00:11.135
But Paranjpay knows me as Rashmi's father.
- Ok.

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:13.501
Now how can I go to his house
as Rahul's father.

01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:14.755
(Laughs)

01:00:14.835 --> 01:00:19.188
Ok. It means you're in a problem
that's why you came to me.

01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:21.455
You called me traitor, lowly.

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.088
You came to hit me.

01:00:23.168 --> 01:00:25.421
I apologize to you.

01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:27.288
We're old friends.

01:00:27.368 --> 01:00:29.388
Why do you apologize?
- Why?

01:00:29.468 --> 01:00:31.687
You can do it for Bandya,
but not for me.

01:00:33.035 --> 01:00:37.085
Not for Bandya, but I
did it for Sharmila.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:42.135
I'll help you to marry Sharmila.

01:00:42.601 --> 01:00:44.355
Yes. I promise you.

01:00:44.435 --> 01:00:46.301
Please, I'm in a problem.
Help me.

01:00:46.401 --> 01:00:48.121
Mr. Paranjpay will get fooled..

01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:49.701
..but what about Rahul and
sister-in-law Anjali.

01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:52.559
It's easy. We'll got
before they reach..

01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:55.075
..and we'll cancel the marriage
and disappear.

01:00:56.468 --> 01:00:57.501
Who are you?

01:01:00.701 --> 01:01:03.401
Anant Kitturkar.
- What? - Anant Kitturkar.

01:01:04.601 --> 01:01:07.002
I'm Anant Kitturkar.

01:01:07.868 --> 01:01:10.305
Mr. Kitturkar. Please come.

01:01:10.635 --> 01:01:12.355
Tanu.
- (Tanuja) Coming, father.

01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:16.035
Come.

01:01:17.665 --> 01:01:19.968
Come. Please sit.

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:26.555
You? How come you're here?

01:01:26.635 --> 01:01:28.588
What?
- How dare you come here?

01:01:28.668 --> 01:01:31.388
What are you saying?
He's Anant Kitturkar, my friend.

01:01:31.468 --> 01:01:33.421
Actually we met on the way.

01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:35.468
He didn't know your address
so I brought him here.

01:01:36.164 --> 01:01:38.689
Thank you. Now get lost.

01:01:38.769 --> 01:01:41.021
What are you saying, Paranjpay?
Is this decency?

01:01:41.101 --> 01:01:45.955
You don't know but he's
a rogue! Kitturkar.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.921
Whom do you called a rogue?

01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:52.035
Our name is same.
We're Kitturkar. His insult is my insult.

01:01:52.135 --> 01:01:53.235
Should we leave?

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:57.049
No, I erred. I didn't mean it.

01:01:57.201 --> 01:02:00.440
Please sit.
- Ok. Anant Rao, sit.

01:02:01.227 --> 01:02:02.377
She came.

01:02:02.905 --> 01:02:03.939
Come, Tanu.

01:02:04.272 --> 01:02:06.505
Look, Mr. Kitturkar has come.

01:02:06.905 --> 01:02:07.939
Greetings.

01:02:08.272 --> 01:02:09.305
Greet him.

01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:11.625
Greetings.
- Go, child..

01:02:11.705 --> 01:02:13.592
..bring two cups of tea.
- One cup of tea.

01:02:13.672 --> 01:02:14.792
He won't drink, I'll.

01:02:14.872 --> 01:02:17.059
Let us see if you can make tea.

01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:19.392
Ok.
- Sit, Mr. Paranjpay. Sit.

01:02:19.472 --> 01:02:20.599
Please sit.

01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:31.590
Listen, Kitturkar. Kitturkar!

01:02:33.905 --> 01:02:36.192
There is nothing special.
I don't like the girl.

01:02:36.272 --> 01:02:37.774
How are you related?

01:02:38.605 --> 01:02:39.639
Listen.

01:02:39.905 --> 01:02:41.972
When will Rahul's mother
and Rahul come?

01:02:42.052 --> 01:02:44.225
They'll come any moment.
So finish it quickly.

01:02:44.305 --> 01:02:45.539
I've no time.

01:02:45.639 --> 01:02:47.825
How.. shut up! How are you related?

01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:49.692
What are you saying,
Mr. Paranjpay?

01:02:49.772 --> 01:02:52.693
He's going to taking about the
deals on our behalf. - Yes.

01:02:52.884 --> 01:02:54.592
Deals? Meaning?

01:02:54.672 --> 01:02:57.972
Marriage is like a deal.
Dowry and other customs..

01:02:58.072 --> 01:02:59.792
Man must be accurate
while using words.

01:02:59.872 --> 01:03:01.773
Deal! That's the apt word.

01:03:02.189 --> 01:03:03.919
Must be apt in deals!
- Yes.

01:03:04.272 --> 01:03:05.492
Word!
- Yes.

01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:07.621
Return my Rs. 10,000 first.

01:03:08.272 --> 01:03:10.472
Which 10,000?
- Whom are you asking money from?

01:03:10.572 --> 01:03:12.425
We're from the boy's side.
- Right.

01:03:12.505 --> 01:03:14.025
Look! Is this the correct way?

01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:15.892
How dare you talk impudently!

01:03:15.972 --> 01:03:18.859
What are you saying? I didn't
know you'd be so indecent!

01:03:18.939 --> 01:03:21.570
We didn't know this family
will be so grumpy.

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:22.639
He's asking for 10,000 rupees.

01:03:22.739 --> 01:03:25.259
And for that he's insulting
the guests.

01:03:25.339 --> 01:03:27.400
Guests! Are you my guest?
- Yes.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.196
Now I'll recover my money
along with interest.

01:03:31.276 --> 01:03:32.659
Hey..
- Just a minute.

01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:35.159
Recovery agent..

01:03:35.239 --> 01:03:36.596
Here.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:40.859
Paranjpay! You're insulting
the groom's family.

01:03:40.939 --> 01:03:42.700
Mr. Kitturkar, now look at this.
- Who?

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.625
Kitturkar, just look at this.

01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:46.975
What kind of a man he's!

01:03:47.304 --> 01:03:49.159
His status is nothing
in front of you.

01:03:49.239 --> 01:03:51.925
He's not related. I'm talking to you.

01:03:52.005 --> 01:03:53.441
Why not?

01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:55.241
We're Kitturkar. We're same.

01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:58.074
Groom's family is insulted.
This marriage is cancelled. - Ok.

01:03:58.154 --> 01:04:00.588
No, Mr. Kitturkar. Listen.
- I'll hear him.

01:04:00.688 --> 01:04:02.488
No. Come.
- Listen to me.

01:04:03.328 --> 01:04:04.081
(Sighs)

01:04:10.654 --> 01:04:11.908
They've reached.
- Who?

01:04:12.245 --> 01:04:16.388
Rahul and Anjali. Introduce me
to them. We haven't met yet.

01:04:16.488 --> 01:04:17.521
Get in.

01:04:18.489 --> 01:04:21.841
(Crying)
- Please don't cry. Kitturkar will come.

01:04:21.921 --> 01:04:24.068
I'm telling you. Rahul
will come too.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.774
Kitturkar, I knew you'd come.
- He left.

01:04:29.854 --> 01:04:31.358
No, you're Kitturkar.
- Yes.

01:04:31.988 --> 01:04:34.403
Thanks, dad. You came before you.

01:04:34.688 --> 01:04:36.408
Why are you outside?
Let's go in.

01:04:36.488 --> 01:04:38.192
We won't step in Paranjpay's..

01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:39.854
Paranjpay's house.

01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:42.032
He has insulted me.

01:04:42.221 --> 01:04:43.659
He insulted you?
- Yes.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.208
My insult is our insult, right?

01:04:46.384 --> 01:04:47.551
We won't stay here.

01:04:47.776 --> 01:04:49.374
You must've fought with him.
- Me?

01:04:49.454 --> 01:04:53.354
Why would I fight? If I'd to fight,
why would I've come here?

01:04:53.578 --> 01:04:56.621
You liked the girl,
so I came to see her.

01:04:56.888 --> 01:04:59.512
But this Paranjpay
doesn't value me.

01:04:59.821 --> 01:05:02.191
Please calm down and tell
us what happened.

01:05:02.271 --> 01:05:05.174
What happened?
You're asking me so softly.

01:05:05.254 --> 01:05:08.223
This insolent man drove me
out of the house.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.037
What? He drove you out!

01:05:10.117 --> 01:05:13.750
He has lost his man!
Many like him work under me.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:14.984
He..

01:05:15.517 --> 01:05:17.350
He drove me out of the house.

01:05:17.684 --> 01:05:19.154
That's really strange.
- Yes.

01:05:19.234 --> 01:05:22.784
Dad, I'll see to it.
- Don't dare to step in this house.

01:05:22.864 --> 01:05:26.584
You want to go to the house
where your father got insulted.

01:05:26.664 --> 01:05:28.784
I should be ashamed..
I mean you.

01:05:29.317 --> 01:05:30.704
You should be ashamed!

01:05:30.784 --> 01:05:35.550
If you step in, I won't see
your face again. Got it?

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.771
Dad... But...
- Marriage or dad? Choose one.

01:05:42.684 --> 01:05:44.050
Father, does it make sense?

01:05:44.764 --> 01:05:47.650
You value your honor
more than my love.

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:50.684
Mother, try to convince him.

01:05:51.043 --> 01:05:53.917
But what I heard is terrible?

01:05:53.997 --> 01:05:56.551
It's not possible. I don't
want to discuss it again.

01:05:56.631 --> 01:05:59.967
(Phone rings)

01:06:00.517 --> 01:06:01.550
Hello.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:03.150
Yes?

01:06:04.817 --> 01:06:06.150
Yes, actually sorry..

01:06:10.293 --> 01:06:11.693
What are you saying?

01:06:13.873 --> 01:06:14.884
What?

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:17.884
Really?

01:06:19.852 --> 01:06:20.917
Sure?

01:06:22.689 --> 01:06:23.917
What are you saying?

01:06:25.335 --> 01:06:27.645
Ok. Yeah!

01:06:28.675 --> 01:06:32.637
Father, thank you. Thanks a lot.

01:06:32.717 --> 01:06:35.404
What happened?
- You're simply great.

01:06:35.617 --> 01:06:37.804
I really misunderstood
you. I'm sorry.

01:06:37.884 --> 01:06:41.070
But you're great!
- Tell me, what happened?

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:44.355
Mother, he already fixed
my marriage with Tanuja.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:45.617
What?

01:06:50.236 --> 01:06:51.127
(Clears throat)

01:06:51.517 --> 01:06:55.170
Where are you going?
- I'll bring sweets.

01:06:55.382 --> 01:06:56.221
Thanks, father.

01:06:56.301 --> 01:06:59.004
Come. Come with me.
- Anant.

01:06:59.084 --> 01:07:00.737
You don't deserve to live.

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:03.383
You're a burden on this earth!

01:07:03.849 --> 01:07:06.686
What? What happened?

01:07:07.516 --> 01:07:10.004
What enmity you've with me?

01:07:10.084 --> 01:07:12.970
We went to cancel this marriage?
- Correct.

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:16.504
Correct, my foot! We'd cancelled
this marriage.

01:07:16.584 --> 01:07:18.304
Yes.
- We'd refused clearly.

01:07:18.384 --> 01:07:21.170
Then why did you accept this
proposal. Why did you stay there?

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.637
When you left, Paranjpay
won't let me go.

01:07:23.717 --> 01:07:26.670
He kept on requesting.
He fell on my feet.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.337
I beg of you.

01:07:28.417 --> 01:07:32.170
Accept m daughter.
She loves your son a lot.

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:35.070
She loves Rahul a lot.
- Please leave my feet.

01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:36.484
My right leg is weak.

01:07:36.584 --> 01:07:38.843
This marriage can't take place.

01:07:38.923 --> 01:07:40.784
(Crying)
- Please wait.

01:07:41.917 --> 01:07:43.137
Don't cry.

01:07:43.323 --> 01:07:45.037
All this belongs to Tanu.

01:07:45.117 --> 01:07:46.937
I've nobody besides her.

01:07:47.017 --> 01:07:51.104
I tell you, bungalow, car,
money and my business..

01:07:51.184 --> 01:07:52.837
..will be transferred
in your name.

01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:54.080
In my name?
- Yes.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.188
She's my only daughter. I'll
give everything to you.

01:07:58.485 --> 01:08:03.233
What happened?
- You went to Paranjpay as Anant Kitturkar.

01:08:03.384 --> 01:08:05.004
So?
- But you're Dhodhapkar.

01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:07.330
Yes.
- Even if he transfers the property..

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:09.294
..it'll be in Anant
Kitturkar's name.

01:08:09.374 --> 01:08:10.836
What will you gain?

01:08:11.095 --> 01:08:12.574
Paranjpay!

01:08:13.023 --> 01:08:14.607
Paranjpay tricked me.

01:08:14.941 --> 01:08:15.974
He gave me hopes.

01:08:16.074 --> 01:08:18.904
Wait! I'll go and cancel
this marriage.

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:21.761
I beg of you. Shut up now!

01:08:21.841 --> 01:08:23.207
Let this marriage take place.

01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:24.672
After this marriage..

01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:27.707
..I'll get Rahul and Tanuja
settled in America.

01:08:28.115 --> 01:08:31.207
But I won't spare that Bandya.

01:08:31.522 --> 01:08:33.807
I'll surely cancel his marriage.

01:08:33.887 --> 01:08:35.041
Why?

01:08:37.507 --> 01:08:38.807
Should I throw you down?

01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:40.207
Why?

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.294
(Burps)

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.341
Don't belch.

01:08:47.772 --> 01:08:49.407
You've to eat more, Rahul.

01:08:49.807 --> 01:08:52.007
I'll blow up. I can't eat now.

01:08:52.365 --> 01:08:55.307
You didn't eat anything
I served you.

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:58.161
No, it's enough.
- Didn't you like it?

01:08:58.241 --> 01:09:00.926
No, the breakfast is
delicious. Really.

01:09:01.274 --> 01:09:03.041
Who made it?
- Me!

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.632
(Laughs)

01:09:07.107 --> 01:09:09.274
Both are good cook.

01:09:09.507 --> 01:09:10.541
Thank you.

01:09:11.045 --> 01:09:12.463
(Laughs)

01:09:14.907 --> 01:09:17.351
I ate such meal after many days.
First class.

01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:18.874
You don't get it at home.

01:09:22.107 --> 01:09:23.641
I get it, father-in-law..

01:09:24.707 --> 01:09:26.974
..but it's different to
eat at your place.

01:09:27.634 --> 01:09:32.096
Actually, I get food cooked by
servants, not by my mother.

01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:34.761
Your mother doesn't cook.

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:36.471
She has no time.

01:09:36.674 --> 01:09:37.941
She has to keep dancing.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:41.677
Saw!
- What? Have you lost your mind?

01:09:42.174 --> 01:09:45.558
For business she has to go
around. That's called dancing.

01:09:45.638 --> 01:09:46.507
Yes.

01:09:47.574 --> 01:09:49.094
Yes. Take it.

01:09:49.174 --> 01:09:50.407
How many servant you've?

01:09:50.674 --> 01:09:51.741
Many!

01:09:52.007 --> 01:09:53.387
Good!

01:09:53.574 --> 01:09:55.227
They keep coming and going.

01:09:55.307 --> 01:09:57.727
I don't have time to even count.

01:09:57.807 --> 01:09:59.561
You ate?
- Yes. - Wash your hands.

01:09:59.641 --> 01:10:01.141
Let's go.
- What's this?

01:10:02.207 --> 01:10:04.699
Wipe them.
- Father, what are you doing? - Come.

01:10:04.907 --> 01:10:06.694
Come.
- Where?

01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.394
To your bungalow.
- Why?

01:10:08.474 --> 01:10:09.641
To count the servants.

01:10:09.721 --> 01:10:10.961
What are you saying?

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.727
Let's go.
- No.

01:10:12.807 --> 01:10:15.227
Let's go and see the
house. Get ready.

01:10:15.307 --> 01:10:17.007
I'm ready.
- Listen.

01:10:17.087 --> 01:10:21.562
Actually house is.. closed.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:24.414
Work is going on. Cleaning
and sweeping!

01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:25.999
Don't worry. Let's go there.

01:10:26.963 --> 01:10:28.596
Nobody is home.

01:10:28.676 --> 01:10:30.763
My parents aren't home.

01:10:30.863 --> 01:10:33.363
We saw you parents. We want
to see the bungalow. - Yes.

01:10:33.443 --> 01:10:37.049
Let's go. - What are you saying?
- Don't make excuses. Let's go.

01:10:37.129 --> 01:10:38.663
What?
- Please.

01:10:41.412 --> 01:10:42.496
Now..

01:10:44.296 --> 01:10:45.396
What?

01:10:45.863 --> 01:10:47.116
I've brought a bike.

01:10:47.196 --> 01:10:49.616
We can't all get on my bike.

01:10:49.696 --> 01:10:55.229
Will we all sit on one bike.
It won't be right. It's not done.

01:10:55.309 --> 01:10:56.529
We'll take a cab.

01:10:56.609 --> 01:10:59.816
If you've no money,
I'll pay the fare.

01:10:59.896 --> 01:11:02.816
Let's go.
- Please come.

01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:04.729
Let's go.
- No.

01:11:04.809 --> 01:11:06.816
Leave me.
- Please come.

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:10.029
Come. Come.
- Walk with me.

01:11:10.109 --> 01:11:12.083
Come. Yes!

01:11:12.163 --> 01:11:14.016
Yes! Yes! Let's hurry.

01:11:14.096 --> 01:11:15.347
We'll take a cab.

01:11:17.163 --> 01:11:18.841
Drive straight.
- Straight.

01:11:19.629 --> 01:11:21.748
Now take right turn.
- Are we there?

01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:23.383
Not so soon.

01:11:23.463 --> 01:11:24.861
Now take a round.

01:11:26.063 --> 01:11:28.663
I think I've forgotten it.
I'll ask for directions.

01:11:29.196 --> 01:11:31.183
You'll ask for directions?
- Yes.

01:11:31.429 --> 01:11:32.998
Drive straight.

01:11:33.496 --> 01:11:36.229
Straight. I know the direction.

01:11:36.829 --> 01:11:37.863
Now right.

01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:39.663
Yes, right.

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.629
Now take a right turn.

01:11:42.192 --> 01:11:44.496
No. Left.

01:11:44.855 --> 01:11:46.386
You stop talking.

01:11:48.063 --> 01:11:50.863
Now take a U- turn.
- Again.

01:11:50.943 --> 01:11:53.183
Turn around.
- U- turn? - Yes.

01:11:53.263 --> 01:11:55.329
We've to do this to
go to our house.

01:11:56.063 --> 01:11:57.129
Good.

01:11:57.749 --> 01:12:00.396
Now wait for 2 minutes.

01:12:02.177 --> 01:12:04.469
We're on the right track.
Drive straight.

01:12:05.129 --> 01:12:06.596
Now take U- turn.

01:12:07.029 --> 01:12:09.629
Again? Circumambulate?
- There is a lane in the middle.

01:12:09.729 --> 01:12:12.396
Again U- turn?
- There is a short cut.

01:12:12.476 --> 01:12:14.665
What going on? Left and right?

01:12:17.589 --> 01:12:19.458
Now this circle came twice.

01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:20.954
So we'll reach home soon.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:24.883
Yes. Now take left turn.

01:12:24.963 --> 01:12:27.416
Again left?
- Keep quiet. Don't confuse him.

01:12:27.496 --> 01:12:30.629
Yes, please. For two minutes.
- Ok.

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:31.996
Take left.

01:12:35.329 --> 01:12:36.849
Do you've water?
- Yes.

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.296
There.

01:12:40.596 --> 01:12:44.696
It's hot. Actually I'm used
to air condition cars.

01:12:47.228 --> 01:12:48.431
Enough?
- Yes.

01:12:49.529 --> 01:12:51.529
Now pull over.

01:12:51.609 --> 01:12:54.396
Left! Yes. There.

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.496
Oh dear! - Come, mother-in-law.
- It's great.

01:12:58.576 --> 01:12:59.803
Let me see his bungalow.

01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:07.412
Oh dear!

01:13:07.492 --> 01:13:09.724
Isn't it great!
- Yes.

01:13:10.364 --> 01:13:11.912
You're very lucky.

01:13:13.243 --> 01:13:15.263
Father-in-law, come.

01:13:15.343 --> 01:13:16.743
You want to see the bungalow.

01:13:17.015 --> 01:13:18.863
Hey! Mother and father are home.

01:13:18.943 --> 01:13:20.621
Come. Get down. What happened?

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:22.943
I'm having chest pain.
- Chest is here.

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:25.396
Father.
- What happened?

01:13:25.476 --> 01:13:27.163
I'm having chest pain.

01:13:27.243 --> 01:13:29.163
Take me to hospital.

01:13:29.243 --> 01:13:32.763
Oh! Why hospital. There is
a doctor in my house.

01:13:32.843 --> 01:13:34.810
Doctor Anjali. Look there.

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:40.696
And his son. He's a compounder.
He helps her. - Let's go.

01:13:40.776 --> 01:13:42.076
We'll let them check.

01:13:42.443 --> 01:13:45.670
What's going on, mother?
- I don't know.

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.410
Go down and check.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:52.396
Get in the car. Your husband is dying.

01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:54.963
What are you saying?
Don't talk of death.

01:13:55.043 --> 01:13:56.703
I don't want to die
in other's house.

01:13:56.783 --> 01:13:58.858
I'll die in my house. Let's go.

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:02.153
What are you doing?
- Was the shock very strong?

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:06.675
He gets chest pain when things go right.
- Really?

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:08.396
Drive the taxi.

01:14:08.476 --> 01:14:09.876
It's not starting.

01:14:09.956 --> 01:14:16.103
(Speaking Tamil)

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.944
What did he say?
- He said, the taxi won't start.

01:14:19.024 --> 01:14:20.196
Such a long sentence.
- Oh dear!

01:14:20.276 --> 01:14:23.043
You know their language.
- We're Kitturkar.

01:14:24.587 --> 01:14:26.628
My death is coming near.

01:14:27.243 --> 01:14:28.245
(Bandya) Oh God!

01:14:28.325 --> 01:14:30.163
Drive fast!
- Father!

01:14:30.243 --> 01:14:31.943
Don't lie on his lap. Get up!

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:34.076
Get up!

01:14:34.576 --> 01:14:35.610
What are you doing?

01:14:36.576 --> 01:14:38.010
You wanted to see the bungalow.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:52.463
(Dhodhapkar) No! No!
I won't go anywhere.

01:14:52.543 --> 01:14:54.163
What are you doing, Dhodhapkar?

01:14:54.243 --> 01:14:56.163
You just have to drop
this letter.

01:14:56.243 --> 01:14:58.963
But do you think I'm a postman
or courier boy?

01:14:59.043 --> 01:15:00.496
Why do you tell me
to do anything?

01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:02.170
You're my trust worthy friend.

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:03.683
This letter is equally
important.

01:15:03.763 --> 01:15:06.237
I'll lose millions in business.

01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:08.517
I'll go bankrupt. This
involves my business.

01:15:08.597 --> 01:15:11.470
Please take my letter.
- Why don't you go?

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:13.669
You know how confusing
it's here!

01:15:13.749 --> 01:15:17.270
I can't leave, Dhodhapkar.
- But I don't know your business.

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:19.303
Don't I know that.
- Yes.

01:15:19.383 --> 01:15:20.692
You don't have to do anything.

01:15:20.772 --> 01:15:22.337
Everything is written
in this letter.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:25.137
You just have to give
it to the addressed..

01:15:25.217 --> 01:15:26.883
..man and take his message.

01:15:26.963 --> 01:15:28.583
But..
- No ifs and buts..

01:15:28.909 --> 01:15:31.183
Look, Dhodhapkar. My business
is at stake.

01:15:31.565 --> 01:15:33.283
Save me somehow.

01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:37.350
You've always helped
me in difficulty.

01:15:37.896 --> 01:15:40.335
I've trusted you before God.

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:42.983
You've toiled hard and saved me.

01:15:43.517 --> 01:15:45.350
You've no desire or
selfish greed.

01:15:46.449 --> 01:15:48.083
You've fulfilled
your friendship.

01:15:48.163 --> 01:15:49.483
You never refused me.

01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:52.470
I'm not refusing even today.
Give me the letter.

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:54.183
Don't worry. Give me.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.869
Dhodhapkar, thanks.

01:15:55.949 --> 01:15:57.450
It's a confidential letter.

01:15:57.702 --> 01:16:00.417
I've written everything
in it. Ok?

01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:02.083
Do I've to say anything?

01:16:02.553 --> 01:16:04.637
You won't have to say anything.

01:16:04.717 --> 01:16:06.683
Come, I'll arrange to send you.

01:16:07.024 --> 01:16:08.950
I mean I'll drop you.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:15.437
Will I get something to eat?

01:16:15.517 --> 01:16:17.470
Wait! Let me finish my chores.

01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:18.617
My foot!

01:16:19.483 --> 01:16:20.717
He won't get married.

01:16:21.121 --> 01:16:23.617
Aaba, I feel he'll surely come.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.337
He fled because he didn't
want to get married.

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:29.683
Why should we waste this
girl's life for Bandya?

01:16:29.763 --> 01:16:31.150
Why don't you understand?

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.464
I know, but Mr. Rao
should understand.

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:37.548
I'll marry him and serve
you for life.

01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:39.918
What's special about Bandya?

01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.817
Any prince will marry you.

01:16:43.817 --> 01:16:46.017
You're so beautiful
and virtuous.

01:16:46.205 --> 01:16:48.463
A prince will come
looking for you.

01:16:48.543 --> 01:16:49.403
(Aaba coughs)

01:16:49.483 --> 01:16:50.517
Greetings.

01:16:51.517 --> 01:16:52.583
Greetings..

01:17:20.117 --> 01:17:21.537
Who are you?

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.391
Come on, Aaba. You
don't have to ask.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.766
(Laughs)

01:17:29.583 --> 01:17:31.128
Don't crush the chilies.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.083
Greetings.

01:17:35.383 --> 01:17:37.137
Who is she?
- Forget that. Who are you?

01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:38.337
I came from Mumbai.

01:17:38.417 --> 01:17:41.150
Are you Aaba Kanse?
- Yes.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:44.770
I've an important work with
you. I've brought a letter.

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.737
A letter for me?
- It's important.

01:17:46.817 --> 01:17:48.323
From Mumbai?
- Yes.

01:17:48.483 --> 01:17:50.018
Letter? Who has sent it?

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:53.717
Read it. You'll know. It's important.
- Ok.

01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:56.737
'Respected Aaba Kanse. Greetings.'

01:17:56.817 --> 01:17:59.004
'Considering your status in society..'

01:17:59.084 --> 01:18:01.720
'..I'm writing this letter
to warn you.'

01:18:01.961 --> 01:18:04.390
'Your son Bandopanth Kanse..'

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.217
'..has taken up the name
Rahul Kitturkar..'

01:18:07.317 --> 01:18:09.803
'..and has fixed marriage with
a girl from low caste.'

01:18:09.883 --> 01:18:12.870
'One who brought the letter
posed as his fake father.'

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:15.783
'This is an act to defile
your respected family.'

01:18:15.883 --> 01:18:18.783
'Don't leave that person.
He knows everything.'

01:18:18.883 --> 01:18:19.983
'Your well-wisher.'

01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:22.683
What happened? Where are you going?

01:18:23.117 --> 01:18:24.617
Listen..
- Don't say anything.

01:18:24.717 --> 01:18:27.617
It's important letter.
- Let me see how he marries.

01:18:27.717 --> 01:18:30.683
But..
- Come with me.

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:32.004
Who is it?

01:18:32.084 --> 01:18:34.484
(Anant) That's not important.
Listen carefully.

01:18:34.826 --> 01:18:38.017
Whom you consider Rahul Kitturkar..

01:18:38.097 --> 01:18:41.223
..is an ordinary boy from slum.

01:18:41.303 --> 01:18:42.324
Bandya!

01:18:42.404 --> 01:18:48.111
Bandya.. - (Anant) If you don't believe,
go to Push Kunj and check it.

01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:51.268
Hello. Hello.

01:18:54.882 --> 01:18:55.850
Yes.

01:18:56.291 --> 01:19:00.564
(Music)

01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:22.143
"With a dimple chin, she smiles
to steal the heart."

01:19:22.223 --> 01:19:27.790
"With enchanting eyes, she's
a beautiful damsel."

01:19:28.156 --> 01:19:33.456
"Bandya, you need
such a partner."

01:19:33.823 --> 01:19:38.890
"Bring a new bride home."

01:19:39.656 --> 01:19:45.243
"A girl like a blossomed flower.."

01:19:45.323 --> 01:19:50.790
"..brother, bring me such
a daughter-in-law."

01:19:51.256 --> 01:19:57.043
"A girl like a blossomed flower.."

01:19:57.123 --> 01:20:02.697
"..brother, bring me such
a daughter-in-law."

01:20:03.162 --> 01:20:08.611
(Music)

01:20:25.823 --> 01:20:31.556
"Bandya has come with pomp."

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:49.143
"Bandya has come with pomp."

01:20:49.223 --> 01:20:54.223
"Even the bride is beauty
personified.

01:20:55.329 --> 01:21:00.643
"Bandya, you need
such a partner."

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:06.290
"Bring a new bride home."

01:21:06.724 --> 01:21:12.423
"A girl like a blossomed flower.."

01:21:12.523 --> 01:21:18.190
"..brother, bring me such
a daughter-in-law."

01:21:18.743 --> 01:21:24.797
(Music)

01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:46.990
"Bandya has come and wedding
bells are ringing."

01:21:59.023 --> 01:22:03.723
"Bandya has come and wedding
bells are ringing."

01:22:04.821 --> 01:22:10.056
"This bride teases him
at the doorstep."

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:15.756
"Bandya, you need
such a partner."

01:22:16.227 --> 01:22:21.026
"Bring a new bride home."

"..brother, bring me such
a daughter-in-law."

01:22:34.043 --> 01:22:39.751
(Music)

01:22:49.227 --> 01:22:50.860
What happened?

01:22:51.927 --> 01:22:53.093
Is there any problem?

01:22:53.318 --> 01:22:55.960
Go.
- Thanks, friend. Thank you.

01:22:56.393 --> 01:22:58.293
Mother, where is the car parked?

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.775
There.
- Thank you.

01:23:13.419 --> 01:23:14.466
Sorry.

01:23:16.568 --> 01:23:17.620
I erred.

01:23:19.753 --> 01:23:21.826
Listen to me..
- What?

01:23:22.753 --> 01:23:24.646
I saw your wealth.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.920
Where is your bungalow and car?

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.823
Listen..
- Don't touch me. Please.

01:23:29.903 --> 01:23:33.106
(Aaba) Bandya! I won't spare you.

01:23:33.186 --> 01:23:34.220
Aaba, you?

01:23:37.753 --> 01:23:38.920
Aaba?
- Yes.

01:23:40.153 --> 01:23:43.106
Scum! You recognized
your real father?

01:23:43.186 --> 01:23:45.506
You fixed marriage without
telling me.

01:23:45.586 --> 01:23:48.584
(Bandya) Listen to me, Aaba.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.873
Is he your father?
- Yes.

01:23:50.953 --> 01:23:52.958
Who is he?
- Hired father.

01:23:53.038 --> 01:23:54.560
Anant Kitturkar.

01:23:55.553 --> 01:23:57.543
Listen..
- You should be locked.

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.506
Oh no! It means she's
not your mother.

01:23:59.586 --> 01:24:02.142
Hey, hello. Do I look
like a mother?

01:24:02.222 --> 01:24:04.806
I did it for him. And chill!

01:24:04.886 --> 01:24:05.983
He's like my brother.

01:24:07.315 --> 01:24:10.473
Fake mother and fake father!
How dare you!

01:24:10.553 --> 01:24:12.020
Aaba, listen.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.873
You're not Rahul Kitturkar.

01:24:13.953 --> 01:24:17.053
No. I'm. I'm Rahul.. but..

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:19.120
Understand me.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.679
Are you ashamed to use
your real name?

01:24:22.025 --> 01:24:23.473
You changed your parents
for marriage.

01:24:23.553 --> 01:24:27.240
Why did you do this?
- To marry a girl from the city.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.840
That's why he came here.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.773
Aaba..
- You tricked me? - No.

01:24:30.853 --> 01:24:32.206
You tricked Nalini there.

01:24:32.286 --> 01:24:34.240
How am I related to Nalini.
- Meaning?

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.273
She's waiting for you and
getting withered.. slim.

01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:40.440
Who is Nalini?
- His to-be wife.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.073
His marriage is already fixed.

01:24:42.153 --> 01:24:44.073
Yes. I accepted it.

01:24:44.153 --> 01:24:45.873
You did it, so how
am I connected?

01:24:45.953 --> 01:24:48.650
Aaba, I won't marry Nalini.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.186
I'll marry Rashmi.

01:24:50.788 --> 01:24:52.406
Because I love her.

01:24:52.486 --> 01:24:54.876
Sorry. I don't love you.
- Heard?

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:57.540
I don't want to marry one who lies.
- Heard again?

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:00.395
Be quiet. Please listen.

01:25:00.819 --> 01:25:04.052
I accept I erred, but
try to understand me.

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:06.207
What and why should
I understand?

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:09.044
Fake name, fake parents
and fake status.

01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:11.605
Why did you do this?
- For you.

01:25:14.053 --> 01:25:15.662
I'd no other option.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.000
I can't bear it.

01:25:18.741 --> 01:25:20.653
Father was telling me
again and again..

01:25:20.733 --> 01:25:22.087
..but I didn't listen to him.

01:25:22.167 --> 01:25:25.988
Now what will happen if he finds out?
- He'll be shocked.

01:25:26.068 --> 01:25:29.320
Shocked! He'll give us shock.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.253
Bandya had to do this act
because of that man.

01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:33.633
You..
- Correct.

01:25:33.978 --> 01:25:37.153
This mess is because of him!
I'll expose him.

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:41.820
Hey! Listen. Now nobody
will say anything.

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:44.767
Why not? Tell me the truth.

01:25:45.117 --> 01:25:49.624
How is my father connected?
- He's not connected.

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.067
It's my mistake. That day
I came to give you gift..

01:25:54.743 --> 01:25:57.077
..I saw you and fell in
love with you. Right?

01:25:57.855 --> 01:26:00.259
That's why you feigned love.
- No.

01:26:00.567 --> 01:26:04.053
I didn't feign love. I really
loved you. I swear.

01:26:04.133 --> 01:26:06.387
Don't swear falsely.
Why did you do this?

01:26:06.467 --> 01:26:08.104
There was no other option.

01:26:08.467 --> 01:26:10.520
Your father wanted
a rich son-in-law.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.520
Do you think we're poor?

01:26:12.679 --> 01:26:15.953
You own 100 acre of land.

01:26:16.033 --> 01:26:17.653
What's the use of that land?
- Meaning?

01:26:17.733 --> 01:26:19.487
Mr. Rao wants that
land that's why..

01:26:19.567 --> 01:26:21.253
..he's getting Nalini
married to me.

01:26:21.333 --> 01:26:23.163
Yes. Don't you know?

01:26:23.457 --> 01:26:25.367
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

01:26:25.467 --> 01:26:27.587
When did I say I wanted
a rich husband?

01:26:27.667 --> 01:26:29.751
I was going to tell
you, darling..

01:26:29.831 --> 01:26:32.097
Shut up!
- I was scared.

01:26:32.333 --> 01:26:36.153
Listen. If I'd told you the
truth, you would've left me.

01:26:36.433 --> 01:26:39.067
And I can't live without you.

01:26:39.567 --> 01:26:42.620
Do you think I'll marry you now?
- Heard?

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:46.253
Come to village.
- Aaba, I beg of you. Keep quiet.

01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:48.778
You tell me to keep quiet.

01:26:48.858 --> 01:26:50.567
Bandya is right.

01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:52.560
Keep quiet now!

01:26:52.897 --> 01:26:55.220
Take him away. I've nothing
to do with him.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.342
Wow! The girl is wise.

01:26:58.667 --> 01:27:03.593
Listen. I must've lied,
but my love is true.

01:27:04.995 --> 01:27:06.439
Why should I believe you?

01:27:07.053 --> 01:27:10.821
Heard? I'm losing trust
that he's my son.

01:27:10.901 --> 01:27:14.820
But you used to call him your
son, don't confuse me.

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:17.333
Now keep quiet or I'll slap you.

01:27:17.413 --> 01:27:19.246
Are you coming with me or not?

01:27:19.326 --> 01:27:23.166
Aaba, I won't marry Nalini.
- You'll go against my words.

01:27:23.246 --> 01:27:26.213
Should I ruin my life
for your honour.

01:27:27.256 --> 01:27:31.213
I too have desires and dreams.
- Dreams?

01:27:31.313 --> 01:27:32.766
That Rao will shoot you.

01:27:32.846 --> 01:27:34.813
I'm ready to get shot for Rashmi.

01:27:35.082 --> 01:27:36.213
What?
- Yes.

01:27:36.513 --> 01:27:39.466
But I won't marry the girl
I don't love.

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:43.964
But the girl you love isn't
ready to marry you.

01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:47.613
Tell me, what does Nalu lack?

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.790
Look at my Rashmi.

01:27:52.946 --> 01:27:57.346
Now tell me, is your Nalini
anything in front of my Rashmi?

01:27:57.813 --> 01:27:59.288
Tell me. Why are you quiet?

01:27:59.513 --> 01:28:01.433
No!
- So you're ready, Aaba?

01:28:01.513 --> 01:28:02.866
Not so.
- You just said it.

01:28:02.946 --> 01:28:04.480
Bandya.
- You said it.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.533
Don't trap me.

01:28:06.613 --> 01:28:08.946
And you too are trapping me.
What about that?

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:12.566
Such a beautiful and virtuous
daughter-in-law..

01:28:12.646 --> 01:28:14.380
..is coming to your house.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.602
Aren't you proud of it?

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.680
Aaba, just think..

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.629
..tomorrow you'll have
grandchildren..

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.938
..fair grandchildren.

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.246
When they'll play on fields..

01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.700
..there won't be difference
between..

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:30.365
..tomatoes and grandchildren.

01:28:30.946 --> 01:28:32.606
Entire village will say..

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.200
..daughter-in-law should
be like Bandya's wife..

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.827
..and grandchildren like Aaba
Kanse's grandchildren.

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:43.280
Bandya, don't say that.

01:28:44.931 --> 01:28:50.197
Aaba, tell me. Were any fair
children born in our family?

01:28:50.915 --> 01:28:52.523
Look at our complexion.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.988
Is it bad?
- Bad?

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.820
Instead of kohl, we've to apply
lime for adornments.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.533
(Laughs)

01:29:00.613 --> 01:29:03.533
Bandya, I really
won't marry you.

01:29:03.613 --> 01:29:06.749
Aaba.
- I'll see to it that you marry him.

01:29:06.829 --> 01:29:08.480
Aaba!

01:29:08.846 --> 01:29:12.800
Just a minute. You objected
to this marriage.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.640
Don't confuse me.

01:29:15.113 --> 01:29:17.699
Dhodhapkar.. excuse me.

01:29:17.779 --> 01:29:20.157
His confusion is cleared.
- Wait.

01:29:22.742 --> 01:29:24.611
Tell me, what about Mr. Rao.

01:29:25.354 --> 01:29:27.102
I forgot him.

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.783
We won't let him know.

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:32.366
We'll see after marriage.
- Ok.

01:29:32.446 --> 01:29:34.454
Yes.
- Ok? - Done.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.433
Daughter-in-law, come.
I'll meet your parents.

01:29:39.513 --> 01:29:41.771
No, Aaba.
- Now what happened to you?

01:29:42.964 --> 01:29:45.113
Father can't tolerate lie.

01:29:48.733 --> 01:29:49.646
Yes!

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.282
That's why for this marriage,
we've to continue this drama.

01:29:57.246 --> 01:29:59.050
Of Rahul Kitturkar?
- Yes.

01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:00.243
(Laughs)

01:30:00.641 --> 01:30:02.180
It's fine.
- Yes.

01:30:02.446 --> 01:30:04.376
Humans are greater than names.

01:30:04.627 --> 01:30:06.613
Let it be.
- Mind blowing!

01:30:19.384 --> 01:30:20.776
Anant!

01:30:22.896 --> 01:30:23.847
(Clears throat)

01:30:27.531 --> 01:30:30.022
(Laughs)

01:30:30.571 --> 01:30:31.924
I praise you.

01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:35.877
I didn't meet anyone
who could defeat me.

01:30:36.154 --> 01:30:39.525
Honestly, I've given up. You're great!

01:30:39.605 --> 01:30:42.558
Anant, what are you saying?
Have you lost your sense?

01:30:42.638 --> 01:30:43.938
I've come to my senses now.

01:30:44.456 --> 01:30:47.791
He could've told Rashmi
the truth and got free.

01:30:47.871 --> 01:30:50.104
We should play the
games with rules.

01:30:50.405 --> 01:30:53.591
If opponent breaks rule, we
still should follow the rule.

01:30:53.823 --> 01:30:56.891
After all you're my
father-in-law.

01:30:56.971 --> 01:30:59.725
Anant, listen to me.
- Don't say anything. Go.

01:30:59.929 --> 01:31:01.390
We're relatives now.
- Yes.

01:31:01.595 --> 01:31:02.929
After all you're an outsider.

01:31:03.009 --> 01:31:06.268
(Laughs)

01:31:07.721 --> 01:31:09.304
(Yawns)

01:31:11.895 --> 01:31:13.029
Mother.

01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:16.897
Fix the date quickly.

01:31:17.162 --> 01:31:18.895
Don't take long.

01:31:19.162 --> 01:31:20.962
It's difficult.

01:31:21.695 --> 01:31:23.562
Difficult? Then forget it.

01:31:24.162 --> 01:31:27.293
We didn't check horoscopes
during our marriage.

01:31:27.662 --> 01:31:29.729
That's was a mistake.
- What?

01:31:30.129 --> 01:31:33.035
I mean, don't interrupt.
He might make a mistake.

01:31:33.562 --> 01:31:39.282
Priest, fix a date quickly.
I'm sleepy. (Yawns)

01:31:39.362 --> 01:31:42.129
Mother, please rest.

01:31:43.529 --> 01:31:46.067
You can lie down. Feel at home.

01:31:47.184 --> 01:31:48.360
Wait.

01:31:48.829 --> 01:31:51.395
Before sleeping, fix
the wedding date.

01:31:53.062 --> 01:31:54.493
Any dry day will be fine.

01:31:55.262 --> 01:31:56.295
Dry day?

01:31:57.295 --> 01:31:59.982
Friday. She said Friday.
- Friday.

01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:04.075
Friday. - Whatever. We're from
bride's side. Keep quiet!

01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:07.729
A jinx has just creeped in.

01:32:07.809 --> 01:32:10.035
(Laughs)

01:32:10.895 --> 01:32:14.142
What? Is the date fixed?

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:17.862
Aaba! Aaba!
- Yes.

01:32:18.164 --> 01:32:19.080
Why do you come here?

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.768
Should I come to fix my
son's wedding date?

01:32:23.848 --> 01:32:25.115
(Laughs)

01:32:25.195 --> 01:32:28.315
Am I on time?
- Listen to me.

01:32:28.395 --> 01:32:29.959
Hold this.
- Ok.

01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:33.272
Aaba. Listen. There..

01:32:35.798 --> 01:32:37.229
Yes.
- Aaba.

01:32:41.495 --> 01:32:44.162
You?
- I'm Bandya's father.

01:32:44.447 --> 01:32:47.128
Aaba. He's my Aaba.

01:32:47.327 --> 01:32:49.704
He calls me Bandya with love.

01:32:50.562 --> 01:32:52.256
He's my brother.

01:32:52.562 --> 01:32:54.862
He stays in village?
- Really? - Yes.

01:32:54.962 --> 01:32:56.849
He's his uncle.
- Yes.

01:32:56.929 --> 01:32:59.162
I'll greet him.
- Bless you.

01:32:59.495 --> 01:33:01.049
Aaba, she's my mother.

01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:02.549
Greetings.
- Aaba.

01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:04.729
And he's my father.
- Greetings.

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:09.048
Anant Kitturkar.
- Yes. - I've heard a lot about you.

01:33:09.128 --> 01:33:10.449
What?
- Aaba.

01:33:10.529 --> 01:33:12.882
Nothing much. Nothing special.

01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:17.318
Aaba, please keep quiet.
- I'm not saying anything.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.163
Priest, find the date.

01:33:20.466 --> 01:33:24.330
Yes. It's difficult.
- What's difficult?

01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:26.144
I forgot to tell you this
important thing.

01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:29.544
Aaba.
- Don't consider Bandya ordinary.

01:33:29.841 --> 01:33:32.610
He's very rich.
- Yes, he has industries.

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:35.584
No! He has 100 acre of fields.
- Fields?

01:33:35.664 --> 01:33:39.410
Yes.
- I've fields too. I've a big land.

01:33:41.438 --> 01:33:46.410
Rahul, is he your real uncle?
- Yes.

01:33:46.733 --> 01:33:49.310
He's like my son..
- Bandya.

01:33:49.742 --> 01:33:51.421
I'm like a son to him.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:56.239
That's not so. But they
look so different.

01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:58.210
Rahul is just like Aaba.

01:33:58.310 --> 01:34:00.444
When he was born, I wasn't
in the village.

01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:03.944
I was there.
- He's just like him. Right, father?

01:34:05.009 --> 01:34:06.830
Yes.
- Right.

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:09.577
That's why I'm giving him
100 acres of land.

01:34:09.657 --> 01:34:11.477
I tell you..
- Aaba.

01:34:14.239 --> 01:34:16.777
Mother.
- Sleep.

01:34:17.016 --> 01:34:20.477
What happened?
- Is the wedding date fixed?

01:34:20.557 --> 01:34:24.510
Yes. The stars aren't favorable.

01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:26.664
There is problem from
father's side.

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:30.077
You don't need to tell that.
Say it quickly.

01:34:30.977 --> 01:34:32.397
There is only one date.
- When?

01:34:32.477 --> 01:34:35.116
9th December at 3.13 pm.

01:34:35.196 --> 01:34:36.977
Or else there is no other date.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.430
Fix that date.

01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:40.989
But how can we do it so soon?

01:34:41.638 --> 01:34:42.944
I'm here, papa.

01:34:44.318 --> 01:34:45.944
Will you wake her up?
- Yes.

01:34:46.044 --> 01:34:48.344
Dear. Dear..
- Yes.

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:52.844
Sister, date is fixed.

01:34:53.235 --> 01:34:55.030
Check it if it's suitable
for you.

01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:57.777
Date is 9th December at 3.13 pm.
- Yes.

01:34:58.027 --> 01:34:59.177
Is it a dry day?

01:35:00.744 --> 01:35:03.477
Is it a Friday? She wants to know that.

01:35:03.557 --> 01:35:05.266
Yes. It's Friday.

01:35:07.472 --> 01:35:09.797
Then it's final.
- Final.

01:35:09.877 --> 01:35:12.116
Final.
- Final.

01:35:12.522 --> 01:35:14.077
Yes.
- Congrats.

01:35:14.744 --> 01:35:18.023
Give us something sweets to eat now.
- Ok.

01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:19.997
I'll get it. What will you've?

01:35:20.077 --> 01:35:21.477
One large will be fine.

01:35:22.877 --> 01:35:25.577
One large?
- One large..

01:35:26.082 --> 01:35:28.677
'Isiz ki pot watmistra.'

01:35:29.844 --> 01:35:34.330
Meaning?
- One plate of sweet pudding.

01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:38.746
It's a Spanish name. She was
in Spain. I was born there.

01:35:38.826 --> 01:35:39.905
Really?
- Yes.

01:35:39.985 --> 01:35:41.462
I'll get it.

01:35:41.542 --> 01:35:44.830
I'll get it.
- "Isiz ki".. - (Phone rings)

01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:47.130
Mother, I'll tell you. Come.

01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:49.110
I'll get it.

01:35:49.446 --> 01:35:52.032
Bandya.
- Mother, you..

01:35:52.444 --> 01:35:54.710
You weren't born in Spain,
but in village.

01:35:55.171 --> 01:36:01.019
I said Spain. Village is called
Spain in Spanish language.

01:36:05.277 --> 01:36:06.764
Hello, darling.

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:09.097
Where are you? When will you
return from Bangalore?

01:36:09.278 --> 01:36:12.927
Don't you care for Rahul's wedding?
- Wedding is fixed.

01:36:13.982 --> 01:36:16.597
We've fixed the wedding date too.
- Great.

01:36:16.677 --> 01:36:18.764
9th December at 3.13 pm.

01:36:18.844 --> 01:36:21.597
Oh! 9th December at 3.13 pm.

01:36:21.677 --> 01:36:23.874
Priest said there was
no other date.

01:36:23.954 --> 01:36:25.796
There is something wrong
with your horoscope.

01:36:27.639 --> 01:36:29.077
3. 13. 9. 12.

01:36:31.747 --> 01:36:33.396
(Manorama) What are you doing? Come.
- My God!

01:36:33.476 --> 01:36:34.797
(Manorama) Are you done?
- (Toilet flushes)

01:36:34.877 --> 01:36:37.338
(Manorama) We've to go for shopping.
I think he's done. Come.

01:37:30.232 --> 01:37:32.989
Which one? This?
- Yes.

01:37:33.551 --> 01:37:36.491
(Bandya) This will look good on Rashmi.

01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:38.505
Wow!
- This will work.

01:37:38.585 --> 01:37:39.605
Hold it.

01:37:39.685 --> 01:37:41.905
Bandya.
- Mother.

01:37:41.985 --> 01:37:44.852
Should I wear such clothes?
- Mother.

01:37:46.352 --> 01:37:49.805
I mean I want western dress.
- Mother..

01:37:49.885 --> 01:37:52.122
..if you don't like
the clothes here,..

01:37:52.202 --> 01:37:53.972
..take father to other shop.

01:37:54.052 --> 01:37:55.820

01:38:42.385 --> 01:38:43.927

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.936

He's buying clothes for himself.

01:40:01.803 --> 01:40:04.966
He was in Bangalore for business.
- Who?

01:40:06.603 --> 01:40:10.966
Business is nothing in front
of his son. So he returned.

01:40:12.111 --> 01:40:13.523
Mother.

01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:43.236
Why do you care?
- Who are you to ask him?

01:40:43.336 --> 01:40:44.636
He has 100..

01:40:44.736 --> 01:40:48.262
Aaba, we've to shop. Come here.

Bandya. Where are you going?

01:41:15.741 --> 01:41:19.129
Bandya, stop. I'm coming.

01:41:24.016 --> 01:41:27.661
You didn't tell me that Anant
Rao returned from Bangalore.

01:41:27.741 --> 01:41:30.436
What?
- Coming. I'm coming upstairs.

01:41:38.107 --> 01:41:39.852
Sister..

01:41:40.341 --> 01:41:43.227
Why didn't you tell me that
Anant Rao came from Bangalore.

01:41:43.307 --> 01:41:45.172
No, he's still in Bangalore.

01:41:45.707 --> 01:41:47.885
No, I just saw him.
- Where?

01:41:48.841 --> 01:41:50.414
In ladies department.

01:41:51.019 --> 01:41:52.381
What?
- Yes.

01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:54.674
Just a minute.

01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:00.794
(Phone rings)

01:42:00.874 --> 01:42:02.927
Hello.

I'm in an important meeting.

01:42:14.374 --> 01:42:17.327
You're strange! You doubt me.

01:42:17.407 --> 01:42:19.126
Please don't disturb me.

01:42:20.207 --> 01:42:21.241
Ok.

01:42:21.437 --> 01:42:24.239
What?
- Didn't I say you must be mistaken?

01:42:24.319 --> 01:42:26.573
He's still in Bangalore
in a meeting.

01:42:26.815 --> 01:42:29.393
No. I saw him.

01:42:29.737 --> 01:42:31.711
His sister was with him.

01:42:32.137 --> 01:42:33.404
Sister?
- Yes.

01:42:34.504 --> 01:42:36.204
I think they must
be in this mall.

01:42:36.284 --> 01:42:38.129
You go there and I'll be there.

01:42:39.304 --> 01:42:40.337
Come on.

01:42:46.004 --> 01:42:47.071
Oh no!

01:42:52.804 --> 01:42:54.103

My daughter is getting married.
I came for shopping. Any problem?

01:43:32.504 --> 01:43:33.957
Dad came from Bangalore.

01:43:34.037 --> 01:43:36.801
Yes, is business important

Tell him.
- Aaba, come here. - Ok.

01:43:51.637 --> 01:43:53.557
He's the girl's father.

01:43:53.637 --> 01:43:55.937
He won't give dowry in wedding.

01:43:56.037 --> 01:43:57.705
Shouldn't we make him spend?

01:43:59.437 --> 01:44:03.099
You want that buy.
Go and buy that. Go.

01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:04.637

01:44:04.924 --> 01:44:06.724
There is a problem.

01:44:06.804 --> 01:44:08.988
Rahul and Anant are

01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:10.791
What? - Yes.

01:44:10.871 --> 01:44:13.729
Oh God! Father-in-law,

01:44:13.809 --> 01:44:15.004
Tell me what to do.

01:44:15.883 --> 01:44:18.556
You leave quickly.

"Four and a half."

01:44:35.464 --> 01:44:36.757
Excuse me.

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:38.499
Real Rahul.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:42.910
You look familiar. Have we met?

01:44:43.571 --> 01:44:45.800
Yes, I too feel so.

01:44:46.071 --> 01:44:47.719
Where?
- I can't remember.

01:44:48.575 --> 01:44:51.274
You go ahead. I'll handle it.

01:44:58.089 --> 01:45:02.189
Rashmi. Where were you?
I was looking for you.

01:45:12.971 --> 01:45:15.891
Oh! You're here and I
was looking for you.

01:45:15.971 --> 01:45:18.824
I was looking for you.

01:45:18.904 --> 01:45:20.504
Go. Come.

01:45:23.493 --> 01:45:25.456
Oh! Everything looks so nice.

Look!
- Yes.

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.654
Look. We should buy something
like that.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:31.993
Yes.

01:45:32.093 --> 01:45:34.527
Oh! These shirts are
hanging upside down.

01:45:35.575 --> 01:45:36.693
Yes. It's here.

01:46:01.627 --> 01:46:02.660
Oh!

01:46:03.427 --> 01:46:04.447
It's nice.
- Yes.

01:46:04.527 --> 01:46:07.020
Is it for your son-in-law?
- No, for my son.

01:46:07.972 --> 01:46:10.600
My daughter is getting married.
So we're tense.

01:46:13.727 --> 01:46:15.980
Pack this.
- We too are tense.

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.434
It's my son's marriage..

01:46:17.514 --> 01:46:19.839
..but shopping alone is a pain.

01:46:20.193 --> 01:46:21.647
My husband is in Bangalore.

01:46:21.727 --> 01:46:22.793
Really?

01:46:25.827 --> 01:46:26.860
Stand here.

01:46:27.527 --> 01:46:30.175
Are you alone?
- No, I've brought him.

01:46:30.727 --> 01:46:31.980
I don't let him leave.

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:33.093
Listen.

01:46:33.972 --> 01:46:34.993
Where did he go?

01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:36.893
Listen.

01:46:52.908 --> 01:46:54.309
You?
- Of course, me.

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:56.991
But you were in Bangalore?
- Yes.

01:46:57.345 --> 01:46:59.242
I came. It's my son's wedding.

01:46:59.481 --> 01:47:01.975
I came back. For shopping.

01:47:02.844 --> 01:47:04.075
Shopping?
- Yes.

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:09.209
Meaning? When I phoned you, you said..
- Pay attention.

01:47:09.675 --> 01:47:14.424
A local from Ghatkopar
is coming towards you.

01:47:14.504 --> 01:47:17.142
Please stay away. Quickly.

01:47:17.444 --> 01:47:18.875
(Anjali) You're shopping here.

01:47:19.995 --> 01:47:21.275
Why didn't you tell me?

01:47:21.941 --> 01:47:24.175
(Anjali) This is not fair, Anant.

01:47:24.255 --> 01:47:27.409
Listen. This shirt is nice
for our son-in-law.

01:47:27.735 --> 01:47:29.129
We should buy it.

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:31.842
Come here.
- (Anjali) You were in Bangalore?

01:47:33.336 --> 01:47:35.321
Surprise!
- Yes.

01:47:35.401 --> 01:47:36.741
Like that..

01:47:38.006 --> 01:47:39.142
Please.

01:47:39.532 --> 01:47:41.922
(Anjali) You should've phoned me.

01:47:46.732 --> 01:47:49.142
Relax. Relax.

01:47:49.769 --> 01:47:51.475
(Phone rings) - Move!
- Oh! It's CM's phone.

01:47:51.575 --> 01:47:53.162
You shop. I'll talk to him.

01:47:53.242 --> 01:47:56.688
Hello. CM. How are you?
- I'll wait for you in the coffee shop.

01:47:58.775 --> 01:48:00.062
What happened?

01:48:00.475 --> 01:48:02.180
Get aside.
- Hello.

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:03.842
Hello.

01:48:04.275 --> 01:48:05.758
Please move.

01:48:06.942 --> 01:48:07.975
Hello.

01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:10.439
Stupid fool!

01:48:10.909 --> 01:48:12.364
Oh! Hi.
- Hi.

01:48:13.375 --> 01:48:15.132
You did your shopping?
- Yes.

01:48:15.342 --> 01:48:17.695
If you'd met earlier, I would've
introduced you to my husband.

01:48:17.775 --> 01:48:20.662
Your husband? Wasn't
he in Bangalore?

01:48:20.742 --> 01:48:24.729
He was in Bangalore, but he
came here to surprise me.

01:48:24.809 --> 01:48:27.529
My husband never surprises me.

01:48:27.609 --> 01:48:29.695
Bye! See you later.

01:48:29.775 --> 01:48:30.915
Ok.
- I've to shop a lot.

01:48:30.995 --> 01:48:32.775
Dear! Where are you?

01:48:42.516 --> 01:48:44.175
"Two plus two.."

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.531
"..is four and half."

01:49:02.909 --> 01:49:06.180
(Dhodhapkar) Oh God! We narrowly
escaped today.

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:11.467
Two mothers-in-law, Rahul,
Mr. Paranjpay.

01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:13.942
This happened now.
What will happen in wedding?

01:49:14.042 --> 01:49:15.260
And your father!

01:49:15.487 --> 01:49:17.062
What did he do?
- What?

01:49:17.238 --> 01:49:20.535
He keep chattering in between.
So much excitement!

01:49:20.615 --> 01:49:23.882
It's his only son's wedding.
He has to be excited.

01:49:24.375 --> 01:49:25.515
But so much!

01:49:25.758 --> 01:49:27.582
He has added to the confusion!

01:49:27.964 --> 01:49:29.328
Make him understand.

01:49:29.408 --> 01:49:31.562
He's already wise.

01:49:31.642 --> 01:49:33.935
That's why the innocent
man is ready to get..

01:49:34.015 --> 01:49:36.215
..his son married in other
name with Rashmi.

01:49:36.422 --> 01:49:39.369
I'm scared as he's innocent.
He might act foolishly.

01:49:39.449 --> 01:49:42.002
Father-in-law, don't worry.

01:49:42.082 --> 01:49:43.315
Tell me, what to do now?

01:49:43.395 --> 01:49:44.949
Nothing. There is dead end.

01:49:45.582 --> 01:49:48.849
How can we manage two
places at one time?

01:49:49.715 --> 01:49:51.515
This is a big problem!

01:49:51.782 --> 01:49:54.149
I've solution to your problem.

01:49:57.315 --> 01:49:59.039
3. 13. 9. 12. Right?

01:50:17.049 --> 01:50:20.935
There is a way to connect
both the stages.

01:50:21.015 --> 01:50:23.669
From this side and that side.
- Yes. Got it?

01:50:23.749 --> 01:50:26.652
This way will help us out.
- Yes.

01:50:26.732 --> 01:50:29.435
We'll move to and fro
when the need be.

01:50:29.515 --> 01:50:31.369
This way we can handle
both the weddings.

01:50:31.449 --> 01:50:33.835
What if there is a problem?
- What problem?

01:50:33.915 --> 01:50:36.264
There will be guests coming
and leaving at the wedding.

01:50:36.344 --> 01:50:37.869
Nobody will ever know.

01:50:37.949 --> 01:50:41.069
But listen..
- No ifs and buts.

01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:43.612
(Snaps finger) Let's arrange everything.
Guests will be coming.

01:50:43.692 --> 01:50:44.669
God!
- What?

01:50:44.749 --> 01:50:48.982
Not to you, but to God!
Are you there?

01:50:51.242 --> 01:50:54.049
Don't shout! Let's go.

01:50:54.549 --> 01:50:55.615
Come.

01:50:55.948 --> 01:50:58.549
Do you know the plan?
Yes. Don't mess it.

01:50:59.982 --> 01:51:01.508
Come, Vasant. Where
are you going?

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:04.725
I'm invited to Kitturkar's wedding.
- Which Kitturkar?

01:51:04.805 --> 01:51:06.515
I don't know, but Aaba Kanse
gave me invitation.

01:51:06.615 --> 01:51:07.682
Show me.

01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:12.048
You can go.
- Ok.

01:51:12.449 --> 01:51:13.907
What's the matter?

01:51:14.415 --> 01:51:15.482
Come, father.
- Yes.

01:51:17.192 --> 01:51:18.282
Look at this.

01:51:20.933 --> 01:51:23.482
He's trying to fool Mr. Rao,
the village head.

01:51:24.115 --> 01:51:25.669
I'll shoot everyone.

01:51:25.749 --> 01:51:28.078
Is this right?
- No!

01:51:39.849 --> 01:51:42.149
Come. Come.
- Come.

01:51:42.249 --> 01:51:44.669
Welcome.
- Let's go.

01:51:44.749 --> 01:51:46.350
Come.
- (Clears throat)

01:51:46.682 --> 01:51:49.539
What are you doing here? Get out.
- Me?

01:51:49.619 --> 01:51:51.002
Not you, Mr. Anant Rao.

01:51:51.082 --> 01:51:54.235
Her daughter's wedding
is there. So go there.

01:51:54.315 --> 01:51:56.735
I thought of attending
this wedding first.

01:51:57.037 --> 01:51:58.922
I've brought Rs.10,000 as gift.

01:52:00.249 --> 01:52:02.902
You'll give me gift
with my money.

01:52:03.124 --> 01:52:04.636
Get lost.

01:52:04.716 --> 01:52:07.135
Mr. Paranjpay! Be quiet!

01:52:07.215 --> 01:52:08.822
His insult is my insult.
- Yes.

01:52:08.902 --> 01:52:11.652
Mr. Anant rao, but..
- No ifs and buts.

01:52:12.815 --> 01:52:14.735
Sorry. I erred.
- Ok.

01:52:14.815 --> 01:52:16.280
I erred.
- Understand?

01:52:16.618 --> 01:52:17.690
(Clears throat)

01:52:19.701 --> 01:52:22.033
Bring your husband.
- Ok.

01:52:23.876 --> 01:52:25.935
Come.
- Yes, come on.

01:52:26.135 --> 01:52:27.819
Greetings.
- Who is he?

01:52:28.335 --> 01:52:29.592
Anant Kitturkar.

01:52:30.001 --> 01:52:31.388
Yes, Anant Kitturkar.
- What?

01:52:31.468 --> 01:52:34.088
Didn't I tell you that there
is another Anant Kitturkar?

01:52:34.168 --> 01:52:35.235
We just met.

01:52:35.576 --> 01:52:39.278
Now? - I came as my daughter
is getting married.

01:52:39.468 --> 01:52:42.155
Don't stop. Let's go.
- Ok.

01:52:42.235 --> 01:52:43.501
Come.

01:52:50.335 --> 01:52:52.468
Greetings.
- Greetings. Welcome.

01:52:52.835 --> 01:52:53.868
Greetings.

01:52:55.035 --> 01:52:56.068
Come.

01:52:56.301 --> 01:52:57.888
Come. Come.

01:52:57.968 --> 01:52:59.196
Welcome.

01:53:00.068 --> 01:53:01.255
Where is your mother?

01:53:01.335 --> 01:53:02.733
She's here.
- Aaba.

01:53:03.268 --> 01:53:05.171
She's aunt.

01:53:05.835 --> 01:53:07.621
Aaba, she means my mother.

01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:08.801
She..

01:53:10.171 --> 01:53:11.105
(Whistles)

01:53:11.502 --> 01:53:13.327
Oh!
- She's there.

01:53:18.853 --> 01:53:20.901
Did you come to dance?

01:53:21.001 --> 01:53:24.274
You're my mother.
Come, everyone is waiting.

01:53:24.354 --> 01:53:25.701
Come.
- Wait.

01:53:28.636 --> 01:53:30.227
Do you know him?
- Greetings.

01:53:31.239 --> 01:53:33.125
Handle the money.
- Ok.

01:53:33.205 --> 01:53:35.025
I'll let him go when
Dhodhapkar comes.

01:53:35.105 --> 01:53:36.887
Greetings.
- He's priest. - Yes.

01:53:37.205 --> 01:53:40.539
Look at the result of
fixing such a date.

01:53:40.934 --> 01:53:42.578
Think twice before fixing
such a date again.

01:53:42.658 --> 01:53:44.939
I want 5 coconuts urgently.

01:53:45.205 --> 01:53:48.592
Urgently? Go to the beach.

01:53:48.672 --> 01:53:52.859
There will be Madan, the coconut vendor.
- Ask him.

01:53:52.939 --> 01:53:54.459
I don't want coconut water.

01:53:54.539 --> 01:53:56.559
Get lost. We're in double tension.

01:53:56.639 --> 01:53:57.772
Get lost or else..

01:53:57.872 --> 01:53:58.905
Greetings.

01:53:59.739 --> 01:54:01.228
Call groom's father.

01:54:01.487 --> 01:54:03.745
Yes. I'll call him.
- Give me.

01:54:07.265 --> 01:54:08.892
Father-in-law, where are you?

01:54:08.972 --> 01:54:10.005
I'm here.

01:54:10.105 --> 01:54:11.631
But where is Dhodhapkar?

01:54:11.917 --> 01:54:13.139
I don't know.

01:54:13.975 --> 01:54:15.748
Send him immediately
if you find him.

01:54:15.939 --> 01:54:16.972
Ok.

01:54:22.505 --> 01:54:25.359
Anant Rao. Where were you?
- I was here.

01:54:25.439 --> 01:54:27.625
People are waiting for you.
- Why?

01:54:27.705 --> 01:54:30.259
I'll introduce you. - Ok.
- Come. - Come.

01:54:30.339 --> 01:54:33.305
What are you doing here?
- Paranjpay.

01:54:33.405 --> 01:54:34.905
Ok, come.

01:54:37.093 --> 01:54:38.892
He's Mr. Mane.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:40.039
Greetings.

01:54:43.639 --> 01:54:44.859
Come. Come.

01:54:45.605 --> 01:54:47.281
Come from here.

01:54:48.705 --> 01:54:51.992
She's Urmila.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

01:54:52.072 --> 01:54:53.938
You? Ok. Ok.
- Paranjpay!

01:54:55.132 --> 01:54:56.739
Mother, who is that man?
- Who?

01:54:56.819 --> 01:54:58.436
The fatso with glasses.

01:54:58.705 --> 01:55:00.294
Paranjpay is entertaining him.

01:55:00.374 --> 01:55:02.439
He's the other Anant Kitturkar.

01:55:03.872 --> 01:55:04.905
Other one?

01:55:05.303 --> 01:55:07.352
His daughter is getting married
in the next hall.

01:55:07.505 --> 01:55:09.843
Other Anant Kitturkar.
It means..

01:55:10.205 --> 01:55:11.925
Her daughter is Rashmi
Kitturkar.

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:14.692
You know here.
- I'd talked to her on phone.

01:55:14.772 --> 01:55:15.805
I'd told you.

01:55:16.139 --> 01:55:17.444
What a coincidence!

01:55:18.605 --> 01:55:20.125
Let's meet her.
- Now?

01:55:20.205 --> 01:55:22.405
Rituals will start in 10 minutes.
- So what?

01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:25.813
I didn't meet her. Let
me see her once.

01:55:25.893 --> 01:55:27.787
It's nearby. Come.

01:55:28.141 --> 01:55:29.672
And she's her mother.

01:55:30.339 --> 01:55:31.635
And she's..

01:55:33.971 --> 01:55:35.672
I've urgent work with him.

01:55:36.453 --> 01:55:37.474
Come.
- Ok.

01:55:38.148 --> 01:55:39.872
Come quickly.
- Come.

01:55:49.936 --> 01:55:51.236
Whom do you want to meet?

01:55:51.316 --> 01:55:55.756
Is Rashmi Kitturkar getting married?
- No, not here.

01:55:55.836 --> 01:55:56.911
It's her wedding.

01:55:56.991 --> 01:55:58.836
Come.
- Where are you going?

01:56:00.236 --> 01:56:02.656
Come quickly. It's the
auspicious time.

01:56:02.736 --> 01:56:04.836
Do it quickly.
- Hi. - Hi!

01:56:04.936 --> 01:56:06.656
What are you doing here? Go away.

01:56:06.736 --> 01:56:07.969
She's Rashmi.
- Yes.

01:56:08.049 --> 01:56:10.589
Go away. Please listen to me.

01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:12.435
We talked on phone.
- What?

01:56:12.803 --> 01:56:14.287
I'm Rahul Anant Kitturkar.

01:56:16.552 --> 01:56:19.223
Wait. How can you be Rahul
Anant Kitturkar?

01:56:19.303 --> 01:56:20.669
Go away.
- Yes.

01:56:20.969 --> 01:56:23.003
How? My name is Rahul..

01:56:23.083 --> 01:56:25.063
..father's name Anant and
surname Kitturkar.

01:56:25.143 --> 01:56:27.669
So I'm Rahul Anant Kitturkar.
Any problem?

01:56:29.785 --> 01:56:32.803
Strange! It's strange!

01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:38.808
It means there aren't two but
three Anant Kitturkar's.

01:56:38.888 --> 01:56:40.103
Yes.

01:56:40.356 --> 01:56:44.326
No, but how can Rahul
Kitturkar be two?

01:56:44.406 --> 01:56:46.269
Mother-in-law.
- Yes.

01:56:46.769 --> 01:56:49.769
If Anant Kitturkar
can be three..

01:56:49.869 --> 01:56:52.689
..can't Rahul Anant Kitturkar be two.
- It's possible.

01:56:52.769 --> 01:56:54.889
That's possible.
- Yes.

01:56:54.969 --> 01:56:56.169
It's the fact.

01:56:56.249 --> 01:56:58.389
No, no.
- Listen to me.

01:56:58.469 --> 01:57:00.703
Listen to me first.

01:57:01.536 --> 01:57:04.866
She talked to him on phone,
but how did she meet you?

01:57:09.492 --> 01:57:10.456
How?

01:57:10.536 --> 01:57:12.649
Yes.
- Right.

01:57:16.843 --> 01:57:18.167
It so happened..

01:57:18.903 --> 01:57:20.036
How?
- Like this..

01:57:20.977 --> 01:57:24.169
It was a wrong number.
My phone was right, mother.

01:57:24.269 --> 01:57:26.336
Oh dear!
- Oh God!

01:57:26.736 --> 01:57:28.169
Yes.
- It's strange.

01:57:28.269 --> 01:57:30.336
The world is round.

01:57:30.416 --> 01:57:32.103
Everything is same.

01:57:33.336 --> 01:57:34.403
You?

01:57:35.136 --> 01:57:36.664
Recognized me?
- What?

01:57:37.603 --> 01:57:40.865
Yes. We met in the mall.
- You're his mother.

01:57:40.945 --> 01:57:42.623
It means we'd to meet again.

01:57:42.703 --> 01:57:43.869
They meet in a mall.

01:57:43.969 --> 01:57:45.703
This is strange too!

01:57:46.903 --> 01:57:49.567
Such coincidences!

01:57:50.869 --> 01:57:53.323
Come, the auspicious time will pass.
- Yes.

01:57:53.403 --> 01:57:55.703
You too are getting married. Go.
- Congratulations.

01:57:55.803 --> 01:57:58.489
Come on.
- There are three Anant Kitturkar. So..

01:57:58.569 --> 01:58:00.989
I can't tell you now.
- Go.

01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:02.350
Bye. Bye.

01:58:03.136 --> 01:58:04.136
Come.

01:58:06.259 --> 01:58:07.695
God!

01:58:08.931 --> 01:58:10.272
Where is he?

01:58:12.636 --> 01:58:14.856
So guests, don't leave
without eating.

01:58:14.936 --> 01:58:16.956
Don't leave without eating.

01:58:17.182 --> 01:58:19.489
Aunt, don't leave
without eating.

01:58:19.569 --> 01:58:21.689
Everyone must eat.

01:58:23.444 --> 01:58:26.039
Son-in-law.
- Son-in-law!

01:58:26.895 --> 01:58:29.611
You left me alone
to face the heat.

01:58:29.966 --> 01:58:32.836
And you were hiding! Now
you call me son-in-law.

01:58:33.771 --> 01:58:36.356
Don't do this. Go to that side.

01:58:36.436 --> 01:58:38.396
They went. You too leave.

01:58:40.341 --> 01:58:42.007
Are you blind? Can't you read the board?

01:58:42.107 --> 01:58:43.574
No Bandya is getting
married here.

01:58:43.674 --> 01:58:45.161
Rahul Kitturkar is
getting married.

01:58:45.241 --> 01:58:46.307
Excuse me.

01:58:47.385 --> 01:58:49.627
What are you doing here?
- It's my house's work.

01:58:49.707 --> 01:58:51.545
It mean your house
is like my house.

01:58:51.625 --> 01:58:53.761
Don't worry about it.
I'll tackle them.

01:58:53.841 --> 01:58:55.661
Don't worry. Come to that hall.

01:58:55.741 --> 01:58:57.289
He's a crazy man. Come.

01:59:00.566 --> 01:59:02.071
Groom's parents should sit here.

01:59:02.151 --> 01:59:04.674
So my work is done?
- Yes. - Come.

01:59:04.754 --> 01:59:06.574
Hurry up. Call the groom's parents.

01:59:06.654 --> 01:59:08.143
Coming.

01:59:08.965 --> 01:59:10.660
What are you doing?
- You sit.

01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:12.707
Let her sit.
- Today is dry day. I won't sit.

01:59:13.905 --> 01:59:16.974
They're like my parents.

01:59:17.054 --> 01:59:18.602
Let them sit.
- Ok.

01:59:18.682 --> 01:59:20.307
Hold this.
- Why me?

01:59:20.974 --> 01:59:24.492
Where is groom's father?
I'm calling him for long.

01:59:24.572 --> 01:59:26.377
I'll find him. Wait.

01:59:31.107 --> 01:59:32.507
Dad, where are you?

01:59:33.210 --> 01:59:34.541
I'm here.

01:59:35.226 --> 01:59:37.861
Priest is calling you for
the ritual. Come soon.

01:59:37.941 --> 01:59:39.784
Tell him to come quickly.
- He's coming.

01:59:40.744 --> 01:59:41.635
Come.

01:59:41.715 --> 01:59:45.250
One Kitturkar has to
sit with Anjali.

01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:47.341
Show me a way or I'll be doomed!

01:59:47.441 --> 01:59:49.083
Possibly I'll be doomed!

01:59:49.163 --> 01:59:51.741
I'm going.
- Stop. Listen.

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:53.607
Let this wedding take place.
- Ok.

01:59:53.814 --> 01:59:55.641
Do as I say.
- Give me your phone. - Here.

01:59:56.707 --> 01:59:58.207
Is this Paranjpay's number?
- Yes.

02:00:00.699 --> 02:00:01.841
Hello.
- Hello.

02:00:02.082 --> 02:00:04.864
Hello, I'm Zhende Patil.
- Minister.

02:00:04.944 --> 02:00:08.413
Yes, you took license of
international tourism from us.

02:00:08.493 --> 02:00:10.641
You came when you'd.

02:00:10.907 --> 02:00:13.636
But you didn't invite me for wedding.

02:00:13.907 --> 02:00:16.327
And when I came..

02:00:16.407 --> 02:00:18.594
..there is nobody to receive me.

02:00:18.674 --> 02:00:20.427
No, listen. Don't be angry.

02:00:20.507 --> 02:00:22.761
I'll come outside.

02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:24.371
I'm coming.
- Hurry.

02:00:25.207 --> 02:00:26.627
Do you know what to do?
- Yes. - Go.

02:00:26.707 --> 02:00:28.307
Sit there.
- Ok. - Come.

02:00:28.407 --> 02:00:29.594
Come on.

02:00:29.674 --> 02:00:30.861
Handle that.
- Ok.

02:00:30.941 --> 02:00:32.274
Come.
- Come.

02:00:44.807 --> 02:00:46.541
Mr. Paranjpay, where were you?

02:00:46.621 --> 02:00:48.942
I'm here.
- Mr. Aaba got furious.

02:00:49.573 --> 02:00:51.594
I'm looking for him.
Where is he?

02:00:51.674 --> 02:00:52.727
He was just here.

02:00:52.807 --> 02:00:55.429
He went there.
- Come.

02:01:00.221 --> 02:01:02.361
Greetings. Greetings.

02:01:02.441 --> 02:01:03.474
Greetings.

02:01:04.941 --> 02:01:06.206
Why are you coming?

02:01:06.407 --> 02:01:07.561
Look at Paranjpay.

02:01:07.641 --> 02:01:09.035
When he comes, just whistle.

02:01:09.242 --> 02:01:11.404
(Soft whistles)
- Not like this, but like this.

02:01:11.841 --> 02:01:13.333
You can't even whistle.

02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:16.107
Dad, where are you?

02:01:16.207 --> 02:01:18.827
I was receiving the guests.
- We were waiting for you.

02:01:18.907 --> 02:01:20.527
Wow! Start it.
- Shoes.

02:01:20.607 --> 02:01:22.059
Sorry. Sorry.

02:01:23.607 --> 02:01:26.081
How can he sit for rituals?

02:01:26.161 --> 02:01:27.407
Kitturkar.

02:01:28.641 --> 02:01:30.294
It's strange. You forgot.

02:01:30.374 --> 02:01:31.729
I'm Anant Kitturkar.

02:01:32.075 --> 02:01:33.407
Anant Kitturkar?
- Yes.

02:01:34.174 --> 02:01:35.707
But he's Anant Kitturkar.

02:01:36.207 --> 02:01:38.394
There are two Anant Kitturkar.

02:01:38.474 --> 02:01:40.127
He too is Anant Kitturkar.

02:01:40.374 --> 02:01:41.872
But to talk of marriage..

02:01:41.952 --> 02:01:44.261
Your father created confusion
at that time.

02:01:47.046 --> 02:01:47.861
What?

02:01:48.153 --> 02:01:51.750
It means that Kitturkar went
to talk of marriage.

02:01:52.027 --> 02:01:53.671
Yes, didn't I tell you?

02:01:55.971 --> 02:01:58.271
You told me, you just met him.

02:01:58.471 --> 02:02:02.111
I meant I met him today
after that day.

02:02:02.971 --> 02:02:04.430
But father thinks that..

02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:08.105
Actually your father has
created a big problem.

02:02:08.633 --> 02:02:12.265
But now I'm telling you, full and final.
Got it?

02:02:12.345 --> 02:02:15.271
Rahul is my son. We both
are Anant Kitturkar..

02:02:15.543 --> 02:02:17.438
..but Rahul is my son.

02:02:20.179 --> 02:02:23.854
Look, I've no confusion.
He's my dad.

02:02:26.864 --> 02:02:28.071
I'm sorry, father.

02:02:28.271 --> 02:02:29.638
Let it be.

02:02:29.718 --> 02:02:33.272
When kids err, elders forgive
them with a big heart.

02:02:33.687 --> 02:02:38.905
But when elders err,
big problems get created.

02:02:40.415 --> 02:02:42.858
Come. Don't look there. Priest,
start the ritual.

02:02:42.938 --> 02:02:44.151
Start it.

02:02:46.124 --> 02:02:47.271
Where did he go?

02:02:47.446 --> 02:02:48.638
Where did he go?

02:02:49.072 --> 02:02:50.791
I'm asking the same.
Where did he go?

02:02:50.871 --> 02:02:52.887
I'm asking the same.
Where did he go?

02:02:55.265 --> 02:03:02.611
(Chanting mantras)

02:03:17.424 --> 02:03:18.758
Auspicious time is passing by.

02:03:18.838 --> 02:03:20.371
Listen, Mr. Paranjpay.

02:03:20.666 --> 02:03:22.291
I'll bring sir when he comes.

02:03:22.371 --> 02:03:23.405
You go ahead.

02:03:23.485 --> 02:03:24.806
Ok.
- Yes.

02:03:25.005 --> 02:03:26.471
Yeah!

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:32.709
(Chanting mantras)

02:03:43.303 --> 02:03:45.498
Greetings!

02:03:47.379 --> 02:03:53.843
(Chanting mantras)

02:04:23.091 --> 02:04:25.156
(Applause)

02:04:25.863 --> 02:04:28.202
Where is that Kitturkar?
I'll shoot today.

02:04:28.652 --> 02:04:29.925
What happened? Who are you?

02:04:30.005 --> 02:04:31.491
He's getting married
deceiving my sister.

02:04:31.571 --> 02:04:33.858
Bandya, marry my daughter.

02:04:33.938 --> 02:04:35.491
What?
- Or stand here.

02:04:35.571 --> 02:04:36.605
Is this right?

02:04:36.955 --> 02:04:38.138
What's the relationship?

02:04:38.477 --> 02:04:39.508
Which girl?

02:04:40.110 --> 02:04:41.071
What's going on?

02:04:41.349 --> 02:04:43.200
Look, we're not related.

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:46.413
You're looking for the Kitturkar
who is in the next hall.

02:04:46.493 --> 02:04:48.626
I'll take you. Come.

02:04:48.813 --> 02:04:49.833
Come.

02:04:49.913 --> 02:04:51.613
Come with me.

02:04:51.693 --> 02:04:52.913
Just shoot him.

02:04:53.075 --> 02:04:55.746
(Chanting mantras)

02:04:56.327 --> 02:04:57.413
Show me.

02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:58.913
Come.

02:04:59.329 --> 02:05:03.190
(Chanting mantras)

02:05:05.446 --> 02:05:06.629
There he is.

02:05:07.819 --> 02:05:08.843
(Gunshot)

02:05:10.906 --> 02:05:12.300
Bandya, you're marrying
secretly.

02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:14.295
I won't spare you.

02:05:21.402 --> 02:05:22.392
Bandya!

02:05:25.512 --> 02:05:26.481
Bandya!

02:05:28.446 --> 02:05:29.470
Move aside!

02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.847
No, Aaba!

02:05:32.406 --> 02:05:33.555
Move aside!

02:05:33.635 --> 02:05:35.054
Aaba, leave me.

02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:48.677
You know what you did?

02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:50.013
What?

02:05:51.147 --> 02:05:52.578
You knocked me.

02:05:53.797 --> 02:05:57.144
(Laughs)

02:06:01.347 --> 02:06:03.000
Shoot him.
- Shoot him.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:04.513
Shoot him.

02:06:05.689 --> 02:06:06.680
Wait.

02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:08.647
Who are you to shoot my father?

02:06:09.847 --> 02:06:11.907
What did you say?

02:06:12.113 --> 02:06:13.933
What did you say?
He's your father?

02:06:14.013 --> 02:06:15.433
Yes.
- He? - Yes.

02:06:15.513 --> 02:06:17.667
He's your father.
- Yes.

02:06:17.747 --> 02:06:18.813
It means..

02:06:19.517 --> 02:06:21.147
You?
- His wife.

02:06:21.227 --> 02:06:22.100
(Gasps)

02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:23.213
Doomed!

02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:25.285
Rashmi!
- Father.

02:06:26.729 --> 02:06:28.683
It means you're his father too.

02:06:29.647 --> 02:06:30.905
It means she's your..

02:06:31.347 --> 02:06:32.533
She's your daughter.

02:06:32.613 --> 02:06:33.698
Daughter.

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:38.413
And you..

02:06:38.513 --> 02:06:39.547
His wife.

02:06:39.952 --> 02:06:41.213
It means..

02:06:41.552 --> 02:06:42.613
Second wife!

02:06:43.084 --> 02:06:44.113
Correct.

02:06:44.213 --> 02:06:46.500
I don't care about second wife!

02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:47.633
Who are you?

02:06:47.713 --> 02:06:49.500
You keep quiet!
- Shut up!

02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:51.880
Shut up!
- Yes!

02:06:52.413 --> 02:06:54.867
You too shut up!
Now you answer me.

02:06:54.947 --> 02:06:56.933
There is nothing to say.
Everything is clear.

02:06:57.013 --> 02:06:59.300
Wait a minute. Let me talk.

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:01.413
Actually he got married..

02:07:01.493 --> 02:07:03.824
You keep quiet! Shut up!

02:07:04.948 --> 02:07:07.347
It means your two children are
getting married in one hall.

02:07:07.447 --> 02:07:08.467
Correct.

02:07:08.547 --> 02:07:12.080
Daughter here and son there.
- Perfect.

02:07:12.646 --> 02:07:14.000
It means two wives.

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:15.380
And two families.

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:17.580
We were fools!

02:07:20.947 --> 02:07:23.734
It means Anant Kitturkar
isn't three or two..

02:07:24.045 --> 02:07:25.067
But only one!

02:07:25.147 --> 02:07:26.501
And it's you, father.

02:07:29.147 --> 02:07:30.467
It means you fooled them.

02:07:30.547 --> 02:07:33.247
Yes.
- You fooled these innocent people.

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.233
Let it be. To err is human!

02:07:36.313 --> 02:07:37.833
Forget it.
- Right.

02:07:37.913 --> 02:07:39.633
Forgive him.
- Listen.

02:07:39.713 --> 02:07:42.067
Did you ever lack anything in life?
- Never.

02:07:42.147 --> 02:07:45.033
Did my children lack anything in life?
- Never.

02:07:45.113 --> 02:07:47.018
Everything went as per my wish.

02:07:47.098 --> 02:07:49.585
Now tell me, aren't
you both happy?

02:07:49.665 --> 02:07:51.585
Let bygones be bygones.

02:07:51.665 --> 02:07:53.198
You apologize.
- Yes.

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:55.032
What a great man!
He's apologizing.

02:07:55.132 --> 02:07:56.552
Forgive him.

02:07:56.632 --> 02:07:58.598
Forgive him! My foot!

02:07:59.332 --> 02:08:01.209
I won't forgive.
- Me neither.

02:08:01.565 --> 02:08:03.218
It means you'll divorce me.

02:08:03.298 --> 02:08:04.332
Divorce!

02:08:04.732 --> 02:08:06.182
Forget that!

02:08:06.432 --> 02:08:08.077
Think of your children's future.

02:08:08.232 --> 02:08:09.585
You'll break their marriages.

02:08:09.665 --> 02:08:11.944
Ok, first let our
children marry.

02:08:12.132 --> 02:08:13.252
We'll see later. Come.

02:08:13.332 --> 02:08:16.385
But what about my daughter's
wedding?

02:08:16.465 --> 02:08:18.309
Who is your daughter?
- She's there.

02:08:21.098 --> 02:08:23.577
Father, don't worry.

02:08:24.465 --> 02:08:25.557
We've fixed it.

02:08:25.732 --> 02:08:27.269
Who is he?

02:08:36.332 --> 02:08:38.451
Everyone got a partner.

02:08:38.732 --> 02:08:42.463
But Kitturkar got trapped
between two wives.

02:08:43.371 --> 02:08:44.732
Two plus two isn't four..

02:08:44.865 --> 02:08:46.095
..but four and half.

02:08:46.298 --> 02:08:53.052
"Only after toiling hard.."

02:08:53.132 --> 02:08:56.218
"..you'll get to eat."

02:08:56.298 --> 02:09:00.104
"This family.."

02:09:00.701 --> 02:09:03.504
I didn't know Anant
cooks so well.

02:09:05.493 --> 02:09:06.785
It's nothing.

02:09:06.865 --> 02:09:12.832
On our honeymoon he made omelet for me.
- Really? - Yes.

02:09:12.965 --> 02:09:14.432
He didn't cook for me.

02:09:14.723 --> 02:09:16.877
So what did you do?

02:09:16.957 --> 02:09:18.485
(Cooker whistle blows)

02:09:18.565 --> 02:09:20.665
It's whistle of the cooker.

02:09:24.651 --> 02:09:25.785
Listen.
- Yes.

02:09:25.865 --> 02:09:27.099
Hot rice is ready.

02:09:27.592 --> 02:09:29.572
You want plain rice
or cumin rice.

02:09:30.091 --> 02:09:31.991
What do you want?
- Cumin rice.

02:09:32.071 --> 02:09:33.332
Cumin rice.
- Get it quickly.

02:09:34.406 --> 02:09:35.184
Ok.

02:09:35.264 --> 02:09:36.646
(Phone rings)

02:09:38.202 --> 02:09:39.499
Answer the phone.
- Ok.

02:09:40.373 --> 02:09:41.585
Hello.
- (Girl) Hello.

02:09:41.665 --> 02:09:43.501
Yes?
- (Girl) Is this Despande's residence?

02:09:43.581 --> 02:09:46.193
No, it's Anant Kitturkar's house.

02:09:46.273 --> 02:09:48.993
(Girl) What? Are you Anant Kitturkar too?

02:09:49.073 --> 02:09:50.107
Yes. Why?

02:09:50.273 --> 02:09:52.907
(Girl) My father's name too
is Anant Kitturkar.

02:09:53.243 --> 02:09:54.307
Really?

02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:56.007
How old are you?

02:09:56.313 --> 02:09:57.440
(Girl) 20 years.

02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:58.640
20?

02:10:00.214 --> 02:10:01.763
Why don't I remember?

02:10:02.273 --> 02:10:03.743
Listen.
- Yes?

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.531
Did I go on a tour 21 years ago
for 2- 3 months?

02:10:07.951 --> 02:10:08.840
Why?

02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:10.913
A 20 year old girl on
phone says her..

02:10:10.993 --> 02:10:13.374
..father's name is
Anant Kitturkar.

02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:26.673
"Two plus two is four
and a half."

02:10:26.753 --> 02:10:32.791
"Two plus two is four
and a half."

02:11:23.807 --> 02:11:30.493
"Two plus two is four
and a half."

02:11:30.573 --> 02:11:36.738
"Two plus two is four
and a half."

02:11:50.774 --> 02:11:57.427
"Two plus two is four
and a half."

02:11:57.507 --> 02:12:04.125
"Two plus two is four
and a half."

02:12:04.205 --> 02:12:10.354
"Two plus two is four
and a half."
